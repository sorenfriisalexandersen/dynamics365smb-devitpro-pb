# Multi-Factor Authentication for [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]  

When using Azure Active Directory authentication with [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)], we recommend that you take advantage of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication to further safeguard access to the application and data. Azure Multi-Factor Authentication delivers strong, single sign-on authentication through a range of verification options, like a phone call, text message, or mobile app notification, and one-time password. It can be used both on-premises and in the cloud to add security for accessing Microsoft online services, remote access applications, and more. For more information, see the [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication documentation](/da-dk/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks).
