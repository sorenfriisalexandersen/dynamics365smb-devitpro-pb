# Business Central Online Security 

This section helps you understand and improve the security of your Dynamics 365 Business Central tenant. In the links below you will find information, guidance and recommended practices related to authentication, data encryption and safely integrating with other services. You will also find information on Business Centralâ€™s certifications and regulatory compliance.


## Authentication
 
Business Central Online uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the authentication method, which is automatically set up and managed for you.
 
## Data isolation and encryption

Data belonging to a single tenant is stored in an isolated database and is never mixed with data from other tenants. This ensures complete isolation of data in day-to-day use as well as in backup-restore scenarios.
Furthermore, Business Central Online uses encryption to help protect tenant data:

- Data is encrypted at-rest by using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and backup encryption.
- Data backups are always encrypted.
- All network traffic inside the service is encrypted by using industry standard encryption protocols.

## Service integration

We recommend that you use encrypted network protocols to connect to the PowerBI server and Business Central web services. For more information, see the following articles:
