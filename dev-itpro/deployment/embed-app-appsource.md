# AppSource for [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)]
  
AppSource is a Market place where [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] partners can provide marketing details (descriptions, whitepapers and videos) about their app.

[!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] partners can choose to promote themselves and their [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] on the AppSource.

The [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] itself (package) should not be uploaded into the AppSource, it is uploaded, deployed and tested via LCS. AppSource in this case is used for the marketing purposes, not as a repository of Apps.
  
Partner can submit the reference to their project in LCS in the AppSource, to make sure the Microsoft team, assessing the apps can access their environment (being invited via LCS) and verify that the necessary technical acceptance criteria are met.
