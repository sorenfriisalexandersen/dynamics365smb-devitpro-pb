# Installing the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central App

The Business Central App is a companion desktop app for Windows 10 or Xbox One that mimics that [!INCLUDE[webclient](../developer/includes/webclient.md)] but has the same look-and-feel as mobile apps. It can be used with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] online or on-premises.

This article describes how to install the Business Central App when you have on-premises solution. If you have a Business Central Online subscription, simply go to [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-dynamics-365-business-central/9nblggh4ql79?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to get the app.

Like the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../developer/includes/webclient.md)], the Business Central App relies on a Business Central web server instance that connects to Business Central Server and database. The Business Central App uses the same application code as the Web client, except it renders the application in a different format.

## Prerequisites

To install the Business Central App, the following requirments must be met:

- You must have a working Business Central on-premises solution that includes a web server instance, server, and database (application and business data).

- The Business Central web server instance must be configured for https (SSL).
- You are set up as a user in Business Central.

    If you installed Business Central, then by default, your Windows account has been added as a user. 

- Computer on which you install the app must meet the [minimum requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-dynamics-365-business-central/9nblggh4ql79?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:regionofsystemrequirementstab) for installing the Business Central App.

## Install the Business Central App 

1. Do one of the following to get the Business Central App:

    - Go directly to [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734848) on Microsoft Store, and select **Get**.

    - From the Business Central installation media (DVD), double-click the setup.exe. Follow Setup until you come to the **[!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]** page, select  **Get the Business Central app from the Microsoft Store**, and then **Get**.

2. On the **Welcome** page, select **Connect to a local or hosted service**.
3. In the **Service name** box, enter the URL for your [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] instance.

    This is the same URL that you use for opening the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../developer/includes/webclient.md)], and has the format: `https://<hostname>:<port>/<web server instance>`, for example, `https://mycomputer:443/BC150`.

    Select the arrow to continue.

4. When prompted, provide a valid user name and password for accessing Business Central. 

    For example, if your deployment is using Windows authentication, this would be your Windows user name and password.

    Select the arrow to continue.

    When completed, the Business Central App will open.
