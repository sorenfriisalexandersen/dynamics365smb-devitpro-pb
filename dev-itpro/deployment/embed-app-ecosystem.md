# [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] Ecosystem Features  
 
[!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] application is running in a rich ecosystem of other Microsoft and 3rd party services, which [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] can decide to take advantage of.  
 
The following integration capabilities of the [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] should be considered: 
 
-   Microsoft Graph – [evaluating]  
-   Dynamics 365 API endpoint (aka native API) – available if the base application objects are unchanged  
-   Microsoft Office Outlook Add-in - available  
-   Microsoft Power BI – available (using the customer's own Power BI license)  
-   Microsoft Power Automate – available (using the customer's own Power Automate license)  
-   Microsoft Power Apps – available  
-   WalkMe (UI walkthroughs) – not available  
-   Microsoft Apps included with [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] (Yodlee, Quick Books, OCR, AMC...) - available, but the partner needs to setup his own agreement with these service providers (if needed)  
-   Azure ML – available via partner's own Azure ML subscription  
-   CDS/CRM integration (with Dynamics 365 for Sales) – pending CDS/CRM decision (Microsoft)  
-   Accountant Hub - available (if available in your country or region)
