# [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] Platform 
When deploying an [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] to the [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] service, the partner must ensure that it is compatible with a supported version of [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] platform. 
## Minor updates
Microsoft will ship minor platform updates monthly and major platform updates every six months. 
Minor updates can include bug fixes and improvements which should not affect the compatibility of the platform with the previous version of the application. In rare situations, partners may be asked to recompile their solution to work with a minor update of a [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] platform. 

## Major updates
Major updates will include changes that can require partners to perform a technical upgrade to make their application work with the new version of the platform.  

## Version availibility
Microsoft is going to make new versions of the [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] platform available to ISVs through the LCS portal. The partner will then have to pick the platform they want to use for deployment of their solution.

## Deploying versions  
When deploying a solution via the LCS portal, it will possible to pick from the last 3 available versions of the platform (minor and major). Every newly released minor or major platform update will be added to the list and simultaneously one older version will be removed form that list.   
The existing deployments, running on the platform versions, which are older than 3 updates will enter a grace period of 30 days and after that, if not upgraded, will be moved out of the standard SLA.
