# [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] Sandbox 
[!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] customers, just like [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] customers, can choose to create a Sandbox environment in addition to their production environment and use it for developing and testing customizations, demos, trainings and similar non-production activities.

The sandbox feature is currently in preview in the [!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] service, so additional license fees can apply when it is made available officially.  

For customizing their tenants, the partners and customers can use VS Code and 50000-50149 object ID range. Learn more about customizing the application at https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralApps
