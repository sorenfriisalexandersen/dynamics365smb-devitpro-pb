# Using the Development Environment from the Command Prompt
>[!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long_md](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] is [!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2_deprecated](../includes/2019_releasewave2_deprecated.md)].

You can start the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] by running finsql.exe at the command prompt. You can also use the finsql.exe command to perform the several development tasks without using the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](../developer/includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)] client.  

  By default, finsql.exe is located at [!INCLUDE[navnow_x86install](../developer/includes/navnow_x86install_md.md)]\\RoleTailored Client\\.  

## finsql.exe Command Syntax  

The finsql.exe has the following syntax.  

```  
finsql.exe [command=<command> | designobject=<object type> <object ID>][,servername=<server>][,collation=<collation>][,database=<database>][,file=<file>][,filter=<filter>][,generatesymbolreference=<yes|no>][,importaction=<default|overwrite|skip|0|1|2>][,langid=<ID>][,logfile=<logfile>][,navservername=<name>][,navserverinstance=<instance>][,navservermanagementport=<port>][,ntauthentication=<yes|no|0|1>][,objectcache=<cache>][,password=<password>][,showalldesignercolumns=<yes|no|0|1>][,suppressbuildsearchindex=<yes|no|0|1>][,synchronizeschemachanges=<yes|no|force>][,temppath=<path>][,tenant=<tenant ID>][,unicode=<yes|no|0|1>][,useoldeditor=<yes|no>][,username=<user name>,]

```  

*synchronizeschemachanges*  

Specifies how to synchronize table definition changes in the business \(tenant\) database in SQL Server. The following table describes the available options.  

|[!INCLUDE[bp_tableoption](../developer/includes/bp_tableoption_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../developer/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**yes**|Before applying changes to the business data table, [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] validates the changed table definition to check for destructive changes to the table. This includes changes that require that data is deleted in the fields of the business data table which are affected by the changes before the changes can be applied.<br /><br /> -   If there are no destructive changes to the table, then the schema changes are applied to the business data table immediately.<br />-   If there are destructive changes, [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] checks that there are table synchronization instructions in an upgrade codeunit. If there are instructions, then the schema changes are applied to the business database table according to the instructions. If there are no instructions, then an error message appears. The table definition changes are not saved and the schema changes are not applied.|  
|**no**|Table definition changes are saved and compiled in the application but the changes are not validated or applied to the business data table. You synchronize the table schema later by doing one of the following:<br /><br /> -   Save or compile the table from Object Designer in [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](../developer/includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)] and choose either the **Now - with validation** or **Force** synchronization option.<br />-   Use the **Sync. Schema for All Tables** option on the **Tools** menu.<br />-   Run the Sync-NAVTenant cmdlet from the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](../developer/includes/nav_shell_md.md)].|  
|force|Table definition changes are applied to the business data table schema without validation. For destructive changes, data in columns of the business data table that are affected by changes will be deleted.<br /><br /> This option ignores any table synchronization instructions for the table in upgrade codeunits.|  

 For more information about table schema synchronization, see [Synchronizing the Tenant Database with the Application Database](../administration/synchronize-tenant-database-and-application-database.md).  

*navservername*  

 Specifies the name of the server that hosts the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance, such as **MyServer**.

For more information, see [How to: Add Translated Strings By Importing and Exporting Multilanguage Files in Dynamics NAV](/dynamics-nav/how-to--add-translated-strings-by-importing-and-exporting-multilanguage-files). 

### Example  
 This example shows how to run the ExportTranslate command to export text strings from the *Demo Database BC* database to a .txt type file that has the path and file name *C:\\bctextstrings.txt*.  

```  
finsql.exe command=exporttranslate,file=C:\bctextstrings.txt,servername=TestComputer01\BCDEMO,database="Demo Database BC"  
```  

## <a name="GenerateSymbolReference"></a>Generatesymbolreference
 
Generates object symbols for developing against the objects in the AL Development Environment. 

### Syntax
```
finsql.exe command=generatesymbolreference,Database=<database name>,servername=<servername>
```

### Example
```
finsql.exe Command=generatesymbolreference,Database="Demo Database BC",ServerName=.\BCDEMO
```

## <a name="GetBuildVersion"></a>GetBuildVersion
Gets the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] product name and build version number that is currently installed and saves the information to a .txt type file.  
  
### Syntax  
  
```  
finsql.exe command=getbuildversion,file=<versionfile>[,logfile=<path and filename>]  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *file*  
  
 Specifies the folder path and file name of the text file, for example *C:\\bcbuildversion.txt*, in which to save the build information. This parameter is required.  
  
 *logfile*  
  
 The folder path and file name of a text file, for example *C:\\bcbuildversionlog.txt*, in which to save error messages that result from the command. If there are no errors when you run the command, then a log file is not created.  
  
### Remarks  
 When you run the command, a file that contains information about the success or failure of the command is automatically created. The file has the name *navcommandresult.txt*. If you specify the *logfile* parameter, then the *navcommandresult.txt* file is created in the folder that is specified by the *logfile* parameter. If you do not specify the *logfile* parameter, the file is created in the same location as finsql.exe file, which by default is [!INCLUDE[navnow_x86install](../developer/includes/navnow_x86install_md.md)]\\RoleTailored Client.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If User Access Control \(UAC\) is turned on and you do not run the command prompt as an Administrator, then the command prompt window runs as a standard user. In this case, if you do not specify the *logfile* parameter, then the command fails because the standard user cannot write to the default location of the finsql.exe file.  
  
### Example  
 This example shows how to run the GetBuildVersions command to get the product name and version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] that is currently installed on the computer. The example saves the build version information to a .txt type file that has the path and file name *C:\\temp\\navbuildversion.txt*. The example also specifies a log file that has the path and file name *C:\\temp\\bcbuildversionlog.txt*  
  
```  
finsql.exe command=getbuildversion,file=C:\temp\navbuildversion.txt,logfile= C:\temp\bcbuildversionlog.txt  
```  
  
 The build version file, in this case *bcbuildversion.txt*, includes information that is similar to the following:  
  
 `Product Name: Business Central`  
  
 `Product Version: 13.0.38865.0` 

## <a name="ImportLangModule"></a>ImportLangModule
Imports a language module from a file to the specified [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] database.  

### Syntax  

```  
finsql.exe command=importlangmodule,file=<importfile>[,servername=<server>][,database=<database>][,filter=<filter>][,logfile=<path and filename>][,username=<username>][,password=<password>][,ntauthentication=<yes|no|1|0>] 
```  

### Parameters  
 *file*  

 Specifies the path and file name of the language module to import. This parameter is required.  

 The file name should have the extension *.flm*, for example, *C:\\ENUlanguagemodule.flm*.  

### Remarks  
 You can specify parameters in any order.  

### Example  
 This example shows how to run the ImportLangModule command to import a language module for Danish \(DAN\) to the *Demo Database NAV \(10-0\)* database. The language module file path is *C:\\DANlanguagemodule.flm*.  

```  
finsql.exe command=importlangmodule,file=C:\DANlanguagemodule.flm,servername=TestComputer01\BCDEMO,database="Demo Database BC"  
```

## <a name="ImportObjects"></a>ImportObjects
Imports objects from a file to the specified database.  
  
### Syntax  
  
```  
finsql.exe command=importobjects,file=<importfile>[,servername=<server>][,database=<database>][,logfile=<path and filename>][,importaction=<default|overwrite|skip|0|1|2>][,username=<username>][,password=<password>][,ntauthentication=<yes|no|1|0>][,synchronizeschemachanges=<yes|no|force>][,navservername=<server name>][,navserverinstance=<instance>][,navservermanagementport=<port>][,suppressbuildsearchindex=<yes|no|1|0>][,tenant=<tenant ID>]  
```

### Parameters  
 *file*  
  
 The path and file name from which you import objects. This parameter is required. The file must have a .fob or .txt file name extension.  
  
 *importaction*  
  
 Specifies how to handle conflicts with existing objects when you import from a .fob file. The possible values are:  
  
-   **default** or **0** \(default\) – If there is a conflict, then an error is logged in the log file and no objects from the file are imported.  
  
-   **overwrite** or **1** – If there is a conflict, then overwrite the existing object with the object in the import file.  
  
-   **skip** or **2** - If there is a conflict, then skip the object. The existing object remains unchanged.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  If you import from a .txt file and there is a conflict, then the objects in the import file overwrite the existing objects in the database.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  After you import an object from a .txt file, you must compile the object before you use it. If you import an object from a .fob file, then the object is compiled automatically after it is imported. 

*suppressbuildsearchindex*  

When importing objects from a .fob file, specifies whether the command will also build the object search index. The parameter has the following values:

-   **no** or **0** \(default\) - the search index is not built.
-   **yes** or **1** – the search index is not built.

 Building the search index makes sure that pages and reports, which are properly configured for search, can be found by the **Tell Me** feature in the client (for more information, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Tell Me](../developer/devenv-al-menusuite-functionality.md). Building the search index will add time to the import operation.
 
Setting `suppressbuildsearchindex=yes` can be useful if you are importing several .fob files. In which case, for example, you could use `suppressbuildsearchindex=yes` parameter on all `import` commands except the last one. Or, you can skip the search index from the command, and run it afterward from the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long_md.md](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] by selecting **Tools** > **Build Object Search Index**.
  
 ### Remarks  
 You use the **ImportObjects** command with the finsql.exe from a command prompt. finsql.exe is the executable file that runs the development environment. By default, finsql.exe is located at [!INCLUDE[navnow_x86install](../developer/includes/navnow_x86install_md.md)]\\RoleTailored Client\\.  
  
 To import objects from a .txt file, you must have a developer license. To import objects from a .fob file, you can have either an end-user license or a developer license.  
 

### Example  
 This example shows how to run a command to import the objects from a .fob file into [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. If any of the objects to import already exist in the database, then overwrite them with the objects from the import file.  
  
```  
finsql.exe command=importobjects,file=C:\NewObjects.fob,servername=TestComputer01,database="Demo Database BC",ImportAction=overwrite  
```  
## <a name="ImportTranslate"></a>ImportTranslate
Imports UI text strings for objects from a text file to a specified [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] database.  

### Syntax  

```  
finsql.exe command=importtranslate,file=<importfile>[,servername=<server>][,database=<database>][,filter=<filter>][,logfile=<path and filename>][,username=<username>][,password=<password>][,ntauthentication=<yes|no|1|0>]  
```  

### Parameters  
 *file*  

 Specifies the path and name of the text file that contains the text strings to import, for example *C:\\translatestrings.txt*. This parameter is required.  

### Remarks  
 You can use this command for translating text strings in multilanguage setup of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. The contents of the text file must be compatible with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. Therefore, the text file will typically have originated from a text file that was previously exported from the database, and then modified. For more information, see [How to: Add Translated Strings By Importing and Exporting Multilanguage Files in Dynamics NAV](/dynamics-nav/how-to--add-translated-strings-by-importing-and-exporting-multilanguage-files).

### Example  
 This example shows how to run the ImportTranslate command to import text strings from a text file to the *Demo Database NAV \(10-0\)* database. The text file that has the path and file name *C:\\bctextstrings.txt*.  

```  
finsql.exe command=importtranslate,file=C:\bctextstrings.txt,servername=TestComputer01\BCDEMO,database="Demo Database BC"  
```  

## <a name="UpgradeDatabase"></a>UpgradeDatabase
Upgrades an existing [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] database.  
  
### Syntax  
  
```  
finsql.exe command=upgradedatabase, servername=<server>, database=<database>[, logfile=<path and filename>][,username=<user name>][,password=<password>][,ntauthentication=<yes|no|0|1>]  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 You use the **UpgradeDatabase** command together with the finsql.exe executable when you want to convert a database from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] to the new version. For example, if you are upgrading several databases, you can create scripts that help you repeat the steps. finsql.exe is the executable file that runs the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)]. By default, finsql.exe is located at [!INCLUDE[navnow_x86install](../developer/includes/navnow_x86install_md.md)]RoleTailored Client\\.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The upgrade is not completed when you have run this command. You must compile all objects, and you must connect to a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. For more information, see [Converting a Database](../upgrade/Converting-a-Database.md).  
  
### Example  
 This example upgrades the *NAV Danish Database* database on the *TestComputer01\\BCDEMO* SQL Server instance.  
  
```  
finsql.exe command=upgradedatabase,servername=TestComputer01\BCDEMO,database="BC Danish Database"  
```
