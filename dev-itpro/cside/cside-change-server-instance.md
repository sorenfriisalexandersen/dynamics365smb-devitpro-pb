# Change the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] in C/SIDE
In some cases, you may want to change the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance that is being used. For example:  

-   When you select an object in Object Designer and then choose the **Run** button, you may want the selected object to run on a different [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance that the one that is currently specified.  

-   You may want to debug a session that is connected to a different [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] than the one that is currently specified.  

### To change the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance by selecting from a list  

1.  In the development environment, on the **File** menu, choose **Database**, and then choose **Information**.  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  If the **Information** menu item is not available, then you must first open a database.  

2.  In the **Database Information** window, in the **Server Instance** field, choose the drop-down arrow to open the **Available Server Instances** window.  

3.  Select a server instance, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The instance that you select is also displayed in the **Options** window.  

### To change the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance by specifying the field in the Database Options window  

1.  In the development environment, on the **Tools** menu, choose **Options**.  

2.  In the **Options** window, in the **Server Instance** field, enter the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. The format is \<*servername*>:\<*port*>/\<*ServerInstance*>.
