### Customize and extend the user assistance

When a prospect signs up for a trial of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] online, or before they buy [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] on-premises, they have access to tooltips that can help them get unblocked, and context-sensitive links to learn more according to the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] user assistance model. If you customize or extend [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], you are expected to also customize the user assistance so that users will have access to content that can help them get started, get unblocked, and learn more. For more information, see [User Assistance Model](user-assistance.md) and [Configure the Help Experience](deployment/configure-help.md).
