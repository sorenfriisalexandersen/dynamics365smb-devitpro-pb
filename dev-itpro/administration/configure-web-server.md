# Configuring [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] Instances

Accessing [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] from the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] or App requires a [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] instance on IIS. You create a [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] instance for the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] by using the [!INCLUDE[prodsetup](../developer/includes/prodsetup.md)] to install the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] or by running the [New-NAVWebServerInstance cmdlet](/powershell/module/Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Management/new-navwebserverinstance). When you set up a web server instance, you are configuring the connection from the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. The connection settings, along with several other configuration settings, are saved in a configuration file for the web server instance.

## <a name="WebClientSettingsFile"></a>About the configuration file
The configuration file for the web server instances is a .json file type called **navsettings.json**. The navsettings.json file is a Java Script Object Notification file type that is similar to files that use the XML file format.

After installation, you can change the configuration by modifying the navsettings.json. There are two ways to modify this file: directly or using PowerShell.

### Where to find the navsettings.json file
The navsettings.json file is stored in the physical path of the web server instance, which is by default is *%systemroot%\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\[WebServerInstanceName]*.

*[WebServerInstanceName]* corresponds to the name (alias) of the web server instance in IIS, for example, *c:\inetpub\\wwwroot\\[!INCLUDE[serverinstance](../developer/includes/serverinstance.md)]*. 

## Modify the navsettings.json file directly

1. Open the navsettings.json in any text or code editor, such as Notepad or Visual Studio Code.

    Each setting is defined by a key-value pair.  
    
    -   In the navsettings.json file, a setting has the format:

        ```
        "keyname": "keyvalue",
        ```
   
    The `keyname` is the name of the configuration setting and the `keyvalue` is the value.
    
    For example, the configuration setting that specifies the Windows credential type for authenticating users is:

    ```
    "ClientServicesCredentialType":  "Windows",
    ```

    Include values in double quotes.
2.  Find the configuration settings that you want to change, and then change the values.

    See the [Settings](configure-web-server.md#Settings) section for a description of each setting.
3.  When you are done making changes, save the file.
4.  Restart the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] instance for the changes to take effect.
    
    For example, in IIS Manager, in the **Connections** pane, select website node for [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)], and then in the **Actions** pane, choose **Restart**. Or, from your desktop, run `iisreset`. 

## Modify the navsettings.json file by using the Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration cmdlet

The PowerShell script module **NAVWebClientManagement.psm1** includes the [Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration cmdlet](/powershell/module/Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Management/Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration) that enables you to configure a web server instance.

1. Depending on your installation, run the [!INCLUDE[devshell](../developer/includes/devshell.md)] or Windows PowerShell as an administrator.

    For more information, see [Get started with the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] cmdlets](../deployment/configure-multiple-web-server-instances.md#GetStartedWebServerCmdlets).

2. For each setting that you want to change, at the command prompt, run the following command:

    ```
    Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration -Server [MyComputer] -ServerInstance [ServerInstanceName] -WebServerInstance [MyBCWebServerInstance] -KeyName [Setting] -KeyValue [Value]
    ```

    Replace:
    -   `[MyComputer]` with the name of the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]
    -   `[ServerInstanceName]` with the name of the server instance, such as **[!INCLUDE[serverinstance](../developer/includes/serverinstance.md)]**.
    -   `[MyBCWebServerInstance]`with the name of the web server instance for the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)].
    -   `[KeyName]` with the name of the setting. Refer to the next section in this article.
    -   `[KeyValue]` with the new value of the setting.


## <a name="Settings"></a>Settings in the navsettings.json

The navsettings.json has the following structure, where settings are included under one of two root elements: `NAVWebSettings` and `ApplicationIdSettings`:

```
{
  "NAVWebSettings": {
     "//ServerInstance":  "Name of the Business Central Server instance to connect to (for client) or listen on (for server).",
     "ServerInstance":  "BC150",
      [...more keys]
 },
  "ApplicationIdSettings": {
      "BlogLink": "https://myBCBlog.com",
      [...more keys]
  }
}
```

`//` indicates a comment that provides help for the setting, and has no affect on the Web Server instance.

The following table describes the settings that are available in the navsettings.json for each root element. If you do not see a setting in the file, this is because some settings are not automatically included as a key in the file. For these settings, you can add the key manually. If you do not add the key, the default value of the setting is used.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If modifying the file directly, place values in double quotes `""`.

### `NAVWebSettings` element settings

|Setting/KeyName|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|AllowedFrameAncestors|Specifies the host name of any web sites in which the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] or parts of are embedded. By default, the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] will not allow a website to display it inside an iframe unless the website is hosted on the same web server.

|SessionTimeout|Specifies the maximum time that a connection between the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] can remain idle before the session is stopped.<br /><br /> In the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)], this setting determines how long an open [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] page or report can remain inactive before it closes. For example, when the SessionTimeout is set to 20 minutes, if a user does not take any action on a page within 20 minutes, then the page closes and it is replaced with the following message: **The page has expired and the content cannot be displayed.**<br /><br /> The time span has the format \[dd.\]hh:mm:ss\[.ff\]:<br /><br /> -   dd is the number of days<br />-   hh is the number of hours<br />-   mm is the number of minutes<br />-   ss is the number of seconds<br />-   ff  is fractions of a second<br /><br /> Default value: 00:20:00|
|RequireSsl|Specifies whether SSL (https) is required. If the value is set to `true` all cookies will be marked with a `\u0027secure\u0027` attribute. If SSl is enable on the Web server, you should set this to `true`.<br /><br /> Values: `true`, `false`<br /> Default value: `false`|  
|ShowPageSearch|Specifies whether to show the ![Tell me what you want to do](../developer/media/search-icon.png "Search for Page or Report") **Tell me what you want to do** icon in the Business Central header. This feature lets users find [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] objects, such as pages, reports, and actions. <br /><br /> If you do not want to show the **Tell me what you want to do** icon, then set the parameter to `false`.<br /><br /> Default value: `true`|  
|UnknownSpnHint|Specifies whether to use a server principal name when establishing the connection between the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] server and [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]. This setting is used to authenticate the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], and it prevents the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] server from restarting when it connects to [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] for the first time. You set values that are based on the value of the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key.<br /><br /> Value: The value has the following format.<br /><br /> \(net.tcp://BCServer:Port/ServerInstance/Service\)=NoSpn&#124;SPN<br /><br /> -   BCServer is the name of the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].<br />-   Port is the port number on which the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] is running.<br />-   ServerInstance is the name of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.<br />-   NoSpn&#124;SPN specifies whether to use an SPN. If the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key is set to `false`, then set this value to NoSpn. If the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key is set to `true`, then set this value to Spn.<br /><br /> Default value: \(net.tcp://localhost:7046/[!INCLUDE[serverinstance](../developer/includes/serverinstance.md)]/Service\)=NoSpn<br /><br /> If you set this key to the incorrect value, then during startup, the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] will automatically determine a correct value. This will cause the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] to restart. **Note:**  For most installations, you do not have to change this value. Unlike the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)], this setting is not updated automatically. If you want to change the default value, then you must change it manually.|  
|DnsIdentity|Specifies the subject name or common name of the service certificate for [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].<br /><br /> This parameter is only relevant when the ClientServicesCredentialType is set to UserName, NavUserPassword, or AccessControlService, which requires that security certificates are used on the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] and [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] to protect communication. **Note:**  You can find the subject name by opening the certificate in the Certificates snap-in for Microsoft Management Console \(MMC\) on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] or [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]. <br /><br /> For more information, see [Authentication and User Credential Type](../administration/users-credential-types.md).<br /><br /> Value: The subject name of the certificate.<br /><br /> Default value: none|
|AuthenticateServer |Specifies whether to authenticate the server by enabling service identity checks on protocol between the Web server and the Business Central Server instance.<br /><br /> Values: `true`, `false`<br /> Default value: `true`|
|HelpServer|Specifies the name of the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Help Server if the deployment uses Help Server. If the deployment uses an online library, remove this setting.<br /><br /> Default value: none| 
|HelpServerPort|Specifies the TCP port on the specified [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Help Server if the deployment uses Help Server. If the deployment uses an online library, remove this setting.<br /><br /> Default value: none|
|OfficeSuiteShellServiceClientTimeout |Defines the time Business Central will wait for the Office Suite Shell Service to respond.<br /><br />**Important:** This setting has been deprecated in Business Central, and it has no effect on the Web Server instance. <br /><br /> Default value: 10|
|UseAdditionalSearchTerms|Specifies whether **Tell me** uses the additional search terms that are defined on pages and reports.<br /><br />The additional search terms are specified by the [AdditionalSearchTerms](../developer/properties/devenv-additionalsearchterms-property.md) and [AdditionalSearchTermsML](../developer/properties/devenv-additionalsearchtermsml-property.md) properties.<br /><br /> If you set this to `false` the additional search terms are ignored.<br /><br /> Default value: true |
|DefaultRelativeHelpPath|Specifies the default Help article to open if no other context-sensitive link is specified.<br /><br /> Default value: none|
|PersonalizationEnabled|Specifies whether personalization is enabled in the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../developer/includes/webclient.md)]. Set to `true` to enable personalization.<br /><br />For more information, see [Managing Personalization](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-manage).|
