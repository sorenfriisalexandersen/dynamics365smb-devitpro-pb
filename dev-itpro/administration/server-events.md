# Business Central Server Admin and Operational Events (EventViewer) List
Events have the source `BusinessCentralServer$[ServerInstance]`. Each event has a unique ID and is assigned to a task category. The source, IDs, and task categories enable you to filter the events that display in Event Viewer. For a description of the task categories, see [Task Categories](server-events.md#TaskCateg).  

The following table lists the events that are generated by the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].  

|Event ID|Level|Task category|Channel|Message/Remarks|  
|--------|-----|-------------|-------|---------------| 
|112|Error|12|Operational|Message:<br />Fatal Sql error. The connection can no longer be used.<br /><br />Remarks:<br />An error occurred on the connection from the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance to the SQL database and the connection could not been established.<br /><br /> This error could be caused by one of the following reasons:<br /><br /> -   The [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] has been stopped.<br />-   The SQL server connection settings are incorrect<br />-   A network failure has occurred.<br />-   A hardware failure has occurred on the server or on your computer.<br /><br /> To resolve this issue, try to restart the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] or see [Troubleshooting: A fatal error occurred. The connection to SQL server cannot be established](/dynamics-nav/Troubleshooting--A-fatal-error-occurred.-The-connection-to-SQL-server-cannot-be-established).|  
|113|Information|12|Operational|Message:<br />Object Change Listener is listening on SQL Server '{0}'in Database'{1}'.<br /><br />Remarks:<br />Occurs when the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance has established a connection to the SQL database. The Change Listener object listens for changes to application objects in the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] database.||200|Error|12|Admin|Remarks:<br />This event ID is used for various errors that occur on [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances. <br /><br />These events indicate that the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is not operating. View the details of each message to determine the cause of the problem.|  
|201|Information|12|Operational|Remarks:<br />This event ID is used for various information messages that occur on [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances.<br /><br />These events are typical conditions and are for information only.|  
|202|Warning|12|Admin|Remarks:<br />This event ID is used for various warning messages that occur on [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances.<br /><br />These events indicate that an unexpected condition occurred on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. In most cases, the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance will still be operational.<br /><br /> View the details of each message to determine the cause of the problem.|

|233|Information|12|Admin|Message:<br />The session attempted to write to table '\[Table Name\]', but the write operation was rejected because it exceeds the optional table limit of the license. The license only permits writing to \[Number\] optional tables per session. The session has already written to the following tables: '\[Table Name\]', '\[Table Name\]', 'and \[Table Name\]'.<br /><br />Remarks:<br />This event pertains to the limited user license that is used on the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] solution. A limited user license specifies how many optional tables a session can write to. For more information about licensing for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], see [Microsoft Dynamics ERP Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=318024).|
|700-706|Critical, Error, Warning, Information |33|Admin|Telemetry events.

##  <a name="TaskCateg"></a> Task Categories  
Task categories logically classify events according to the operations that they perform. In Event Viewer, you can sort, include, or exclude events in the Windows Application log based on the task categories. A task category is defined by a decimal number. The following table lists the task categories that are associated with [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] events.  

|Task category|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../developer/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
|8|Service connects to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.|  
|11|Service disconnects from the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.|  
|12|Information, warning, or error message from the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.|  
|13|Exception thrown by [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].|
