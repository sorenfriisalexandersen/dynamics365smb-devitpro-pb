# How to: View Performance Counter Data for a Data Collector Set
When you run a Data Collector Set, the data that is collected for performance counters is stored to a log file \(.blg\) in the location that was defined when the Data Collector Set was created. In Windows Performance Monitor, you can view log files to see a visual representation of performance counter data.  
  
### To view the Data Collector Set log file  
  
1.  Start Windows Performance Monitor.  
  
    -   Choose **Start**, in the **Search** box, type **perfmon**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the navigation pane, expand **Monitoring Tools**, and then choose **Performance Monitor**.  
  
3.  In the console pane toolbar, choose the **View Log Data** button.  
  
     The **Performance Monitor Properties** page opens at the **Source** tab.  
  
4.  In the **Data Source** section, select **Log files**, and then choose the **Add** button.  
  
5.  Browse to the log file that you want to view, and then choose the **Open** button.  
  
6.  Choose the **OK** button.
