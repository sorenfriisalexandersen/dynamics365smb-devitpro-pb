# Disable Logging Events to the Windows Application Log
Because the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]vents are always logged to the Application and Services Logs, you can disable logging [!INCLUDE[s[!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]e Windows Application log and not lose any data. The Windows Application log contains events from several applications and components. Disabling logging to the Windows Application log enables you to limit the amount of data that is stored.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you are using System Center Operations Manager to monitor [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] do not disable logging to the Windows Application log. If you do, monitoring will not work.  
  
 To disable logging to the Window Applications Log, you can use the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] or modify the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]onfiguration file \(CustomSettings.config\).  
  
## To configure custome telemtery logging to the Windows Application log by using the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)]  
  
1.  To start the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)], choose **Start**, and in the **Search programs and files** box, type **[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Administration**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the left pane, under **Console root**, select the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] 
  
3.  In the center pane, choose the **Edit** button.  
  
4.  Under **General**, clear the **Enable Event Logging to Windows Application Log** check box.  
  
5.  Choose the **Save** button, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
     You must restart the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]or the changes to take effect.  
  
6.  To restart, the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]in the left pane, select the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] computer.  
  
     Unless you are administering a remote computer, this is [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] \(local\).  
  
7.  In the center pane, right-click an instance, and then choose **Restart**.  
  
## To disable logging to the Windows Application log by modifying the CustomSettings.config file  
  
1.  Open the CustomSettings.config file for the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]n a text editor, such as Notepad.  
  
     By default, the file is located in the [!INCLUDE[prodinstallpath](../developer/includes/prodinstallpath.md)]\\Service folder or [!INCLUDE[prodinstallpath](../developer/includes/prodinstallpath.md)]\\Service\\Instances\\\<instancename> folder \(for multitenant installations\).
