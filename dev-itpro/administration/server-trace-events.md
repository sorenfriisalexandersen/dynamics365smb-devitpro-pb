# Business Central Server Trace Events
This article provides an overview of the trace events that are generated by [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] server instance.

## Overview
-  There are two event trace providers that publish different trace events to the event log: **Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Server** and **Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Common**. The **Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Common** provider is strictly for telemetry trace events. All other events use **Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Server**. You typically need to specify the event trace provider in the monitoring tool that you are using.  
  
-   There are several types of trace events for each event trace provider, including: Windows event viewer, SQL traces, service calls, AL function calls, and telemetry. Trace event types are identified by a keyword with a corresponding decimal and hexadecimal value. The keywords and values enable you to collect data on specific trace events. Some tools support the hexadecimal values only and other tools support both hexadecimal and decimal.  
  
-   For some trace events, there is separate event for when an operation starts and when it stops. This enables you to determine the duration of the operation. Some monitoring tools, such as PerfView, will automatically return the duration in the stop event.  
  
-   Some monitoring tools might interpret and display the collected event trace differently than others. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](server-trace-events.md#ArgRef).  
  

## Windows Event Viewer Trace Events  
Windows Event Viewer trace events track errors, warnings, and information messages that provide information about the condition or state of [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances. These events can be viewed in the **Dynamics365BusinessCentral** channel logs and **Application** log of Event Viewer on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]. For more information, see [Monitoring Business Central Server Events Using Event Viewer](monitor-server-events-windows-event-log.md). 
  
|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Server|EventViewer|1|0x1|  

For a list and description of EventViewer trace events, see [Business Central Server Admin and Operational Events](server-events.md).

## SQL Trace Events  
SQL trace events track a specific set of SQL statements that are executed from the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance against the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] database on SQL Server.  
  
|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Server|SQLTracing|2|0x2|  
  
The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] user, and the SQL statement. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](server-trace-events.md#ArgRef).  
  
The following table lists the SQL trace events.

## Service Call Trace Events  
 Service call trace events track when [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] clients run the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] objects: Queries, Reports, and XMLports.  
  
|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|

|Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Server|ServiceCall|4|0x4|  
  
The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] user, and the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] object ID. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](server-trace-events.md#ArgRef).  
  
The following table lists the service call trace events.  
  
|ID|Event \(task/opcode\)|What is traced|  
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------|  
|300|RunQuery/Start|[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Query objects that are opened and closed.|

|501|CloseSession|[!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)]s and [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)]s establish a connection to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.|  
  
## AL Methods Trace Events  
AL function tracing events track the execution of AL functions and statements on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.  
  
|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Server|ALTracing|8|0x8|  
  
The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] user, ALAL function, AL statements, and line number. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](server-trace-events.md#ArgRef).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is not configured for full AL function tracing, then only root-level AL function will be traced. Statements and AL functions that are called from functions will not be traced. By default, the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is not configured for full AL function tracing. For information about how to specify full AL function tracing, see [Configuring Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md).  
  
The following table lists the AL function tracing events.  
  
|ID|Event \(task/opcode\)|What is traced|  
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------|  
|400|ExecuteALFunction/Start|AL functions that are called.| |401|ExecuteALFunction/Stop|AL functions that are called.|  
|402|ExecuteALFunctionFailed|Errors that occur when executing AL functions. The errors can be caused by exceptions or [ERROR Function \(Dialog\)](../developer/methods/devenv-ERROR-method-Dialog.md) calls.|  
|403|ExecuteALFunction|AL statements that are executed.<br /><br /> **Important:** This trace event is only traced when the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] is configured to full AL function tracing.|  

## Telemetry Trace Events

Telemetry trace events can provide data about operations in the application and how it is being used in production. These events include both system telemetry trace events and user-defined, custom telemetry trace events. 

|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|Microsoft-Dynamics365BusinessCentral-Common|TelemetryTracing|32|0x20|  

Custom telemetry trace events are emitted from the application. These are events that are sent by [SENDTRACETAG method](../developer/methods/devenv-sendtracetag-method.md) calls from inside the application. For more information about custom telemetry trace events, see [Instrumenting an Application for Telemetry](../developer/devenv-instrument-application-for-telemetry.md).

Some of the important event data that is collected for both system and custom telemetry trace events includes: tag, category, message, dataclassification.  For more information about this data, see [Event Trace Data](server-trace-events.md#ArgRef). 

Telemetry events can have one of the following event IDs, based on the data classification and verbosity (or seveity level):

|  Data classification |  Verbosity | ID  |
|----------------------|------------|-----|
|All except CustomerContent and EndUserIdentifiableInformation|Critical|700|
||Error|701|
||Informational|702|
||Informational|703|
||Verbose|704|
||Warning|705|
||Informational|706|
|CustomerContent or EndUserIdentifiableInformation|Critical|707|
||Error|708|
||Informational|709|
||Informational|710|
||Verbose|711 |
||Warning|712 |

>[!NOTE]
> Event IDs 703, 706, and 710 are used only for system telemetry trace events. All other IDs are used for both system and custom events.
