# Enable Business Central Debug Logs in Event Viewer

Some [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] events are collected in the following **Debug** logs specific to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] in Event Viewer:

-   **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Dynamics365BusinessCentral** > **Server**

- **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Dynamics365BusinessCentral** > **Common**

By default the **Debug** logs are disabled and may also be hidden in the Event Viewer. To collect trace event data, you must enable the **Debug** logs.  
  
### To enable Debug logs in Event Viewer  
  
1.  On the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], start Event Viewer.  
  
     For more information, see [How to Start Event Viewer](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg163894.aspx).  
  
2.  In the console tree, choose **Applications and Services Logs**, **Microsoft**, **Dynamics365BusinessCentral**, and then **Server** or **Common**.  
  
3.  If the **Debug** log is not shown under **Server**, then on the **View** menu, select **Show Analytic and Debug Logs**.  
  
4.  Select the **Debug** log, and then on the **Actions** menu, choose **Enable Log**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Depending on the number of events, you might have to increase the maximum size of the log. The default value is 1028 KB. For more information, see [Set Maximum Log Size](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=517563).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] trace events will now be recorded in the **Debug** log. For a list and description of trace events, see [Business Central Server Trace Events](server-trace-events.md).
