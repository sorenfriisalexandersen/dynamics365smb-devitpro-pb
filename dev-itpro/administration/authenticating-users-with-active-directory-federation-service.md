# Authenticating Users with Active Directory Federation Services

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] supports Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) authentication for authenticating users, without having to use the Access Control Service (ACS). This article walks you through the steps about how to set up AD FS authentication in AD FS Management console, and then how to configure it in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)].

## Prerequisites
Your deployment must meet the following prerequisites:

-   Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is installed on the computer that you want to prepare as the federation server.

    For more information, see [Active Directory Federation Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=849251).

    To complete the steps in this article, you will need to know the public URL for AD FS server. This URL needs to be accessible from a web browser on the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.

    >[!Note]
    >The steps in this article are based on using the AD FS version on Windows Server 2016, but should also work with earlier versions of AD FS. Be aware that some dialog box references in the steps might be slightly different in earlier versions of AD FS.

-  A working [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] deployment that includes the following components:
    -   [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].
        
    -   [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)].

        The web server instance must be configured to use SSL (https) for client connections. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](../deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection.md)

    -   [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)] (optional)

    -   [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] (optional)
    -   [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] (optional)

    >[!Important]
    > The deployment must be configured with security certificates to secure remote connections. For more information, see [Using Security Certificates with Business Central On-Premises](../deployment/implement-security-certificates-production-environment.md).

## Configure AD FS to allow [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] authentication

These steps are done by using the AD FS Management console on the server where AD FS is running.

### Set up a Relying Party Trust for the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] clients

You must complete these steps separately for [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] for the Web client and [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. 

1.  Open **Server Manager** on the computer that is running AD FS, choose **AD FS** > **Tools** > **AD FS Management**.
2.  Right-click **Relying Party Trusts**, and then choose **Add Relying Party Trust**.

    ![AD FS Management](../media/ADFS_Console.png "AD FS Management")

    The **Add Relying Party Trust Wizard** appears.
3.  In the **Welcome** step, choose **Claims aware**, and then choose **Start**.

    ![AD FS Relying Trust Wizard](../media/ADFS_Relying_Trust_Wizard.png "AD FS Relying Trust Wizard")
4.  In the **Select Data Source** step, choose **Enter data about the relying party manually**, and then choose **Next**.
5.  In the **Specify Display Name** step, give the relying party a name, such as `Business Central Web Client` or `Dynamics NAV Windows Client`, and then choose **Next**.
6.  In the **Configure Certificate** step, choose **Next** to skip specifying the token encryption certificate.

    This assumes that the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] is running https.
7.  In the **Configure URL** step, select the **Enable support for the WS-federation Passive protocol** check box.

    ![AD FS Configure URL](../media/ADFS_Relying_Trust_ConfigureURL.png "AD FS Configure URL")

    Then, in **Relying party WS-Federation Passive Control URL** field, enter the URL for the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] client according to the following:

    -    If you are setting up AD FS for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)], set this to the full URL for the Web client. The URL typically has the format:

            ```
            https://<web-server-computer>:<port>/<webserver-instance>
            ```
           or
                
            ```
            https://<domain>/<webserver-instance>
            ```

            Replace `<webserver-instance>` with the instance name of the [!INCLUDE[webserverinstance](../developer/includes/webserverinstance.md)] as defined in IIS for your installation. Make sure that the case matches exactly. For example:

            ```
            https://MyWebServer:443/BC130
            ```
            or
            ```
            https://corp.sample.com/BC130
            ```
             
    -   If you are setting up AD FS for the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)], you can use any URL as long as it is in the form of a trusted URL `https://<name>`, such as `https://mynavwinclient` or `https://www.cronus.com`. The URL does not have to point to a valid target, it is only used by AD FS to validate the client. For example, you could just use the domain name of your site:

        ```
        https://corp.sample.com

        ```

    Choose **Next** to continue.

    >[!Note]
    >This is the URL to which AD FS will be allowed to issue authentication tokens. The URLs that you specify will be used later on when you configure the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)].

8.  In the **Configure Identifiers** step, in the **Relying party trust identifier** field, remove the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] URL <!-- check-->, and then add a URL that identifies the client instead. You can use any value as long as it has the for format `https:<name>`: 

    -   For example, if you are setting up AD FS for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)], you could use the following URL:
        ```
        https://bcwebclient
        ```
    -   If you are setting up AD FS for the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)], you could use add the URL:
        ```
        https://dynamicsnavwinclient
        ```

    Choose **Next** to continue.

    >[!Important]
    >This is the URL which is used to identify the relying party, and it has to be unique for the AD FS setup. This URL will be used as the **wtrealm** parameter in the **WSFederationLoginEndpoint** setting of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance configuration (CustomSettings.config file).

9.  In the **Choose Access Control Policy** step, setup multi-factor authentication if required, and then choose **Next**.
10.  Review the configuration, and then choose **Next**.
11. On the **Finish** step, select the **Configure claims issuance policy for the application** check box, and then choose **Close**.

Based on whether you will be using SAML tokens or JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are supported from AD FS 3.0 and later, you need to add different claims. Complete one of the following procedures for your token type.

### Set up support for SAML 1.0 tokens

1. Choose the **Edit Claims Issuance Policy** action.
2. In the **Edit Claim Rules** dialog box, choose **Add Rule**.

    ![AD FS Edit Claims Rule](../media/ADFS_Edit_Claims-Rule.png "AD FS Edit Claims Rule")
3. In the **Select Rule Template** step, choose **Transform an Incoming Claim** template, and then choose **Next**.
4. In the **Configure Rule** step, set the **Claim rule name** to `name`, the **Incoming claim type** to `UPN`, and the **Outgoing claim type** to `Name`. Choose **Finish** when done.
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 to add another rule, except this time, set the **Claim rule name** to `objectidentifier`, the **Incoming claim type** to `Primary SID`, and the **Outgoing claim type** to:

    ```
    https://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier
    ```

    Choose **OK** when done to close the **Edit Claim Rules** dialog box.

    ![AD FS Edit Claims Rule Done](../media/ADFS_EditClaimsRule3.png "AD FS Edit Claims Rule Done")

### Set up support for JSON Web tokens (JWT)

1.  Choose the **Edit Claims Issuance Policy** action.
2.  In the **Edit Claim Rules** dialog box, choose **Add Rule**.

    ![AD FS Edit Claims Rule](../media/ADFS_Edit_Claims-Rule.png "AD FS Edit Claims Rule")
3.  In the **Select Rule Template** step, choose **Send Claims Using a Custom Rule** template, and then choose **Next**.
4. Set the **Claim rule name** to `name`, and the  **Custom rule** to:

    ```
    c:[Type == "https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn"] => issue(Type = "unique_name", Issuer = c.Issuer, OriginalIssuer = c.OriginalIssuer, Value = c.Value, ValueType = c.ValueType);
    ```
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add another custom rule, except for this rule, set the **Claim rule name** to `objectidentifier`, and the **Custom rule** to:

    ```
    c:[Type == "https://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/primarysid"] => issue(Type = "oid", Issuer = c.Issuer, OriginalIssuer = c.OriginalIssuer, Value = c.Value, ValueType = c.ValueType);
    ```
6.  Close the **Edit Claim Rules** dialog box.

    ![AD FS Edit Claims Rule Done](../media/ADFS_EditClaimsRule2.png "AD FS Edit Claims Rule Done")
7.  Start Window Powershell, and run the following command to define the token type for the relying party to be JWT:

    ```
    Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust –TargetIdentifier "[Relying party trust identifier]" –EnableJWT $true
    ```
    
    Replace `[Relying party trust identifier]` with the relying party trust identifier that you added in AD FS for the client, for example:

    ```
    Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust –TargetIdentifier "https://bcwebclient" –EnableJWT $true
    ```

    or
    ```
    Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust –TargetIdentifier "https://dynamicsnavwinclient" –EnableJWT $true
    ```

## Configure [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] to use AD FS authentication

To setup [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] for ADFS authentication, you must modify the configuration of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)], and [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)]s.

### [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance setup

The [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance must be configured to allow claims based authentication. You can do this by using the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)], the [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/Set-NAVServerConfiguration) in the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)], or by modifying the server instance's CustomSettings.config file directly.

<!-- 1. Clear the **Disable Token-Signing Certificate Validation** check box (In the CustomSettings.config file, you set the `DisableTokenSigningCertificateValidation` value to `true`.) -->

1.  Set the **Credential Type** (ClientServicesCredentialType) to `NavUserPassword` or `AccessControlService`.
    -   If you set this to `NavUserPassword`, client users can use either NavUserPassword or claims based authentication to access [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. The CustomSettings.config file should include the following line:

        ```
        <add key="ClientServicesCredentialType" value="NavUserPassword"/>
        ```
    -   If you set this to `AccessControlService`, only clients that use claims based authentication will be allowed to access [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. The CustomSettings.config file should include the following line:

        ```
        <add key="ClientServicesCredentialType" value="AccessControlService"/>
        ```
2.  Set the **WS-Federation Metadata Location** (ClientServicesFederationMetadataLocation) to the URL that defines the federation metadata XML document for your AD FS. The URL has the following format:

    ```
    https://<Public URL for AD FS server>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml
    ```

    Replace `<Public URL for AD FS server>` with the URL for your installation. For example:


    ```
    https://MyADFSServer/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml"/>
    ```

    or
    ```
    https://corp.sample.com/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >This URL must to be accessible from a browser on the computer running the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].

3.  For the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)], set the **WSFederationLoginEndpoint** (WSFederationLoginEndpoint) to point to the AD FS login page for authenticating users.

    ```
    https://<Public URL for ADFS server>/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=<Relying party trust identifier>%26wreply=<Business Central Web Client URL>/SignIn" />
    ```

    Replace `<Public URL for AD FS server>` with the URL for your installation.

    Replace `<Relying party trust identifier>` with the exact value that was specified as the  **Relying party trust identifier** in the earlier task (**Set up a Relying Party Trust for the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] clients**).  

    Replace `<Business Central Web Client URL>` with the exact value that was specified for **Relying party WS-Federation Passive Control URL** field in the Relying Party Trust set up for the client in AD FS. Make sure that the case matches exactly.

    For example:

    ```
    https://corp.sample.com/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=https://bcwebclient%26wreply=https://MyWebServer:443/BC130/SignIn
    ```

    or

    ```
    https://corp.sample.com/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=https://bcwebclient%26wreply=https://corp.sample.com/BC130/SignIn
    ```
4. For the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)], set the **Valid Audiences** (ValidAudiences) to the exact value that was specified as the  **Relying party trust identifier** in the earlier task (**Set up a Relying Party Trust for the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] clients**). For example:
    ```
    https://dynamicsnavwindowsclient
    ```
5.  Restart the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.

    >[!TIP]
    >You can use the [Set-NAVServerInstance cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/Set-NAVServerInstance) to restart the service instance.

### Set up the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)]
You configure the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] by modifying it's [navsettings.json configuration file](configure-web-server.md#WebClientSettingsFile).

Change the **ClientServicesCredentialType** setting to `AccessControlService` as shown:

```
"ClientServicesCredentialType":  "AccessControlService",
```

The configuration changes are automatically picked up by the Internet Information Service (IIS).

>[!TIP]
>Instead of re-configuring the existing web client, consider using the [New-NAVWebServerInstance cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/New-NAVWebServerInstance) in the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] to add an additional web server instance, and leave the existing instance running NavUserPassword authentication.

### Set up the Dynamic NAV Windows client (optional)
>[!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)] is [!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2_deprecated](../includes/2019_releasewave2_deprecated.md)].

You configure the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)] by modifying the ClientUserSettings.config file for each client installation.

1.  Set the **ClientServicesCredentialType** to `AccessControlService` as shown:

    ```
    <add key="ClientServicesCredentialType" value="AccessControlService" />
    ```

    This means that authentication is delegated to the URL that is specified by **ACSUri** setting.
2.  Set the **ACSUri** setting to the AD FS login page as shown:

    ```
    <add key="ACSUri" value="https://<Public URL for ADFS server>/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=<https://dynamicsnavwinclient%26wreply=<Relying Party Trust Endpoint>" />
    ```
    Replace `<Public URL for AD FS server>` with the URL for your installation.

    Replace `<Relying party trust identifier>` with the exact value that was specified as the  **Relying party trust identifier** in the earlier task (**Set up a Relying Party Trust for the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] clients**).  

    Replace `<Relying Party Trust Endpoint>` with the same value that was specified for **Relying party WS-Federation Passive Control URL** field in the Relying Party Trust set up for the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)] in AD FS.

    For example:

    ```
    <add key="ACSUri" value="https://corp.sample.com/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=https://dynamicsnavwinclient%26wreply=https://corp.sample.com" />
    ```
3. Restart the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)].


### [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] User setup
You must map the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] to corresponding user accounts in AD FS. The mapping is based on the User Principal Name (UPN) that is assigned to the user in Active Directory. The UPN is the user's name in email address format, such as `username@corp.sample.com`.

You can do this by using the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] client. Open the **User Card** page for a user, and then in the **Office 365 Authentication** section, set the **Authentication Email** field to the UPN of the AD FS user.

When you initially set the **Authentication Email**, the **Authentication Status** will be **Inactive**. After the first time the user signs in to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] by using AD FS, the status will be change to **Active**. This means that the Primary SID from AD FS has been registered on the user in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], and all subsequent authentication mappings will be done on the Primary SID and not on the Authentication Email (UPN).

For more information, see [Managing Users and Permissions](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions).
