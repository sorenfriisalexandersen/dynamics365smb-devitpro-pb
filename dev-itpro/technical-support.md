# Technical Support for [!INCLUDE[prodlong](developer/includes/prodlong.md)]

Each customer of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] has a partner who assists with technical support when requested by the internal administrator. As a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] reselling partner, you are an administrator of your customers' [!INCLUDE[prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] tenants, and you are the first line of support. This means that you will get requests for support from your customers that you must triage, investigate, and either resolve or escalate to Microsoft.  

In this section, you can learn about the tools that are available to you to help you troubleshoot your customers' [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)].  

## Configuring the support experience

Because you are the first line of support for your customers, you must make it easy for them to contact you. To that end, there is a section in the [Help and Support](/dynamics365/business-central/product-help-and-support?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/toc.json) page in your customers' [!INCLUDE[prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] tenants where they can find this information.  

### To supply your support contact information in the administration center

1. In the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)], choose the environment that you want to specify your contact details for, such as *Production*, and then choose the **Manage Support Contact** button.
2. Fill in the **Name**, **Support email address**, and the **Support website address** fields, so that your users know how to contact you for technical support.
3. Optionally, choose the **Apply to all environments** checkbox if you want to add the same details to all related environments.

<!--Temporary setup
### To supply your support contact information for a tenant

1. In your customer's tenant, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](developer/media/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Support Contact Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Support website address**, specify the URL to where your customer can learn about your technical support.
3. In the **Support email address**, specify the email address if this is how your customer can reach your technical support.

    To use the email account that you are logged in with, choose the *Use my authentication email* link; otherwise, specify the relevant email address.

### On-premises deployments

In on-premises deployments of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)], the **Help and Support** page does not contain the section for contacting technical support. Instead, you can enter an agreement with your customer's administrator about how and when to contact you.  

There are two other links in the **Help and Support** page that you can customize:

- Blog

    Specifies a link to where your customers can access a blog about their solution  
- Coming soon

    Specifies a link to where your customers can access a roadmap for future changes

If you choose to not modify these settings, then the links go to Microsoft's blog and release notes.

For more information, see [Configuring [!INCLUDE[webserver](developer/includes/webserver.md)] Instances](administration/configure-web-server.md).

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> The **Help and Support** page is available only in the browser.  
-->

## Troubleshooting and support

The [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] is your primary tool to support your customers. However, you can also log in to the customer's [!INCLUDE [prodshort](developer/includes/prodshort.md)] as the delegated admin for troubleshooting. For more information, see [Managing Technical Support](administration/manage-technical-support.md).
