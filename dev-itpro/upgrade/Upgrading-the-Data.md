# Upgrading the Data to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]: Single-Tenant Deployment

[See print-friendly quick reference](singletenant-upgrade-checklist.md)

This article describes the tasks required for upgrading the data of a [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] database to a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] major version or cumulative update.

This article pertains to a single-tenant deployment. For upgrade instructions for a multitenant deployment, see [Upgrading the Data: Multitenant Deployment](Upgrading-the-Data-Multitenant.md).

## About Data Upgrade

You use data conversion tools provided with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] to convert the old data with the old version’s table and field structure, so that it functions together with the new version’s table and field structure. Mainly, only table objects and table data are modified during the data upgrade process. Other objects, such as pages, reports, codeunits, and XMLports are upgraded as part of the application code upgrade process.

The data upgrade process described in this article leads you through the database conversion (technical upgrade) and then the upgrade of the actual data, which is achieved by using the upgrade toolkit/upgrade codeunits.

##  <a name="Prereqs"></a> Prerequisites
  
Before you start the upgrade tasks, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:
1.  Your computer uses the same codepage as the data that will be upgraded.

    If you use conflicting codepages, some characters will not display in captions, and you might not be able to access the upgraded database. This is because [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] must remove incorrect metadata characters to complete the data upgrade. In this case, after upgrade, you must open the database in the development environment on a computer with the relevant codepage and compile all objects. This adds the missing characters again.

    Optionally, you can export the captions before the upgrade. For more information, see [How to: Add Translated Strings for Conflicting Text Encoding Formats](/dynamics-nav/How-to--Add-Translated-Strings-for-Conflicting-Text-Encoding-Formats).

2. (Upgrading from [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] only) Custom V1 extensions used in the old deployment have been converted to V2 extensions.

    For more information, see [Converting Extensions V1 to Extensions V2](../developer/devenv-upgrade-v1-to-v2-overview.md).

3. You have upgraded the application code, and have the FOB files that contain the upgraded application code.

    For more information about upgrading the application code, see [Upgrading the Application Code](Upgrading-the-Application-Code.md).

4. You have the upgrade toolkit FOB files for the version that you are upgrading from. 

    The upgrade toolkit includes upgrade codeunits for handling the data upgrade. The upgrade toolkit can be in the same FOB file as the application code or in a separate FOB file.

    For W1 versions, you can find the default upgrade toolkit objects in the  **UpgradeToolKit\Data Conversion Tools** folder on the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] installation media (DVD). Choose the FOB that matches the [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] version from which you are upgrading:

    |  From  |  To Business Central April 2019  |  To Business Central October 2018   |
    |-----------|-------|-----------|
    | [!INCLUDE[navcrete](../developer/includes/navcrete_md.md)]| Upgrade80014x.FOB |Upgrade800130.FOB|
    | [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](../developer/includes/navcorfu_md.md)]| Upgrade90014x.FOB| Upgrade900130.FOB|
    |[!INCLUDE[nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)]| Upgrade100014x.FOB| Upgrade1000130.FOB|
    |[!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](../developer/includes/nav2018_md.md)]| Upgrade110014x.FOB|Upgrade1100130.FOB|
    |[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Fall 2018]| Upgrade13x14x.FOB|Not applicable|

   For local versions, you will find the upgrade toolkit objects in the **UpgradeToolKit\Local Objects** folder. The files follow the same naming convention except they include the 2-letter local version, such as **Upgrade110014x.DK.fob** for Denmark or **Upgrade110014x.DE.fob** for Germany.

5. You have exported the customized permission sets (except SUPER) and permissions from the old database that you want to reuse in the upgraded database.

    - When upgrading from [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)]

      To export permission sets and permissions, you run running XMLPort 9171 and 9172.

      It is important that you exclude the SUPER permission set when running XMLPort 9171. You can do this by adding the filter `Role ID is <>SUPER`.

      For more information, see [Exporting and Importing Permission Sets and Permissions](how-to--import-export-permission-sets-permissions.md#ExportPerms).

    - When upgrading from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]

        In the client, search for and open the **Permission Sets** page, select the user-defined permission sets that you want to keep, and then choose **Export Permission Sets**. This action runs XMLPort **9173 Export Permission Sets**.

6. If the old deployment uses data encryption, you have exported the encryption key file that it used for the data encryption.  

    For more information, see [How to: Export and Import Encryption Keys](how-to-export-and-import-encryption-keys.md).

7. \(Optional\) Make a copy of the configuration file (web.config or navsettings.json) for all [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server_instance_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_server_instance_md.md)] instances in the old deployment. 

8. [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] has been installed. 

    As a minimum, you must install the following components:
    - Server
    - SQL Server Components
    - [!INCLUDE[webservercomponents](../developer/includes/webservercomponents.md)]
    - [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)]([!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2_deprecated](../includes/2019_releasewave2_deprecated.md)]).
    - AL Development Environment
    - (optionally) [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)]

    For more information, see [Installing Business Central Using Setup](../deployment/install-using-setup.md).

> [!NOTE]
>If the old [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] application uses Payment Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP, be aware that this was discontinued in [!INCLUDE[nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)]. This means that most of the objects that are associated with this feature will be deleted during the upgrade. Some objects you will have to manually delete.

## <a name="SQLBackup"></a> Task 1: Create full SQL backup of old database  

Create a full backup of the old database in the SQL Server. Alternatively, you can make a copy of the old database and perform the upgrade tasks on the copy.  

For more information, see [Create a Full Database Backup \(SQL Server\)](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-full-database-backup-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15).  

## Task 2 Uninstall all extensions in old database

Open the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell_md](../developer/includes/nav_shell_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] that matches to old database, and run these commands:

1. To get a list of the extensions that are installed, run this command:

    ```
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Tenant default
    ```
    
    Replace `<ServerInstanceName>` with the name of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server_md](../developer/includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance that the database connects to.

2. For each extension, run this command to uninstall it:

    ```
    Uninstall-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
    ```
    Replace `<ServerInstanceName>` with the name of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server_md](../developer/includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance that the database connects to.
    
    Replace `<Name>` and `<N.N.N.N>` with the name and version of the Extension V1 as it appeared in the previous step.

    Alternately, to remove them all at once, you can run this command:

    ```
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Tenant default | % { Uninstall-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name $_.Name -Version $_.Version }
    ```

## <a name="UploadLicense"></a> Task 3: Upload [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] partner license to old database  

By using the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] that matches the old database, upload the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] license to the database.

For more information, see [Uploading a License File for a Specific Database](../cside/cside-upload-license-file.md#UploadtoDatabase).  

## <a name="DeleteObjects"></a> Task 4: Delete all objects except tables in old database

In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](../developer/includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)] version that matches the database, open the old database, open Object Designer, select all objects except tables, and then choose **Delete**.

You can also use the [DeleteObjects](/dynamics-nav/deleteobjects
) command of the finsql.exe.

## <a name="ClearServer"></a>Task 5: Clear server instance and debugger breakpoint records in old database

Clear all records from the **dbo.Server Instance** and  **dbo.Debugger Breakpoint** tables in the database in SQL Server.  

1. Make sure that you stop the old server instance, and close any tools that connect to the database, such as the Dynamics NAV Administration Tool and [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](../developer/includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)].
2. Using SQL Server Management Studio, open and clear the **dbo.Server Instance** and  **dbo.Debugger Breakpoint** tables of the old database. For example, you can run the following SQL query:

    ```
    DELETE FROM [<My NAV Database Name>].[dbo].[Server Instance]
    DELETE FROM [<My NAV Database Name>].[dbo].[Debugger Breakpoint]
    ```

## <a name="ConvertDb"></a> Task 6: Convert old database to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]

If the database is on Azure SQL Database, you must first add your user account to the **dbmanager** database role on master database. This membership is only required for converting the database, and can be removed afterwards. 

To convert the old database to the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] format, run the new [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long_md](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], open the old database, and follow the conversion instructions.

If you do not run the development environment as an administrator, you will get an error and the conversion will be stopped.

For more information about how to open a database, see [Open a Database](../cside/cside-open-database.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not run schema synchronization at this time. Choose to run it **later**.

## <a name="ImportAppObj"></a> Task 7: Import upgraded application objects to converted database

Using [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long_md](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], import the application objects that you want in the database. This includes the application objects FOB file (from the application code upgrade) and the upgrade toolkit objects FOB file.

1. Import the application objects FOB file first, and then import the upgrade toolkit FOB file.

    For more information, see [Importing Objects](../cside/cside-import-objects.md).

2. **IMPORTANT** When prompted about table synchronization, set the **Synchronize Schema** option to **Later**.  

3. When you import the FOB file, if you experience metadata conflicts, the **Import Worksheet** windows appears.

    Review the Worksheet page. For more information, see [Import Worksheet](../cside/cside-import-worksheet.md).
    
    Choose **Replace All**, and then **OK** to continue.

## <a name="ConnectToServer"></a> Task 8: Connect a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance to converted database

You use the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] or [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=401394) in the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] to connect a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance to the converted database.  

The service account that is used by the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance must be a member of the **db\_owner** role in the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] database on SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.

For more information, see [Connecting a Server Instance to a Database](../administration/connect-server-to-database.md) and [Giving the account necessary database privileges in SQL Server](../deployment/provision-server-account.md#dbo).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When upgrading a large database, you should increase the **SQL Command Timeout** setting for the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance, to avoid timeouts during schema synchronization. The default setting is 30 minutes.  

## <a name="CompSysTables"></a> Task 9: Compile all objects in converted database

1. In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], set it to use the server instance that connects to the database.

    For more information, see [Changing the Server Instance](../cside/cside-change-server-instance.md).  

2. Use the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] or finsql.exe to compile all objects. This includes the imported application objects, data tables, and system tables. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >Choose to run schema synchronization later. For example, in Object Designer, choose **Tools**, choose **Compile**, set the **Synchronize Schema** option to **Later**, and then choose **OK**. For more information, see [Compiling Objects](../cside/cside-compiling-objects.md).

3. (Upgrade from [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](../developer/includes/navcorfu_md.md)] and earlier only) If you get errors on the following table objects, use the Object Designer to delete the objects because they are no longer used.

    - Table 470 Job Queue (replaced by the [Task Scheduler](../developer/devenv-Task-Scheduler.md))
    - Table 824 DO Payment Connection Details
    - Table 825 DO Payment Connection Setup
    - Table 827 DO Payment Credit Card
    - Table 828 DO Payment Credit Card Number
    - Table 829 DO Payment Trans. Log Entry
    - Table 1510 Notification Template

    When you delete a table object, in the **Delete** confirmation dialog box that appears, set the **Synchronize Schema** option to **Force**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > In this step, it is very important that you do not use the **Sync. Schema For All Tables** option from the **Tools** menu.

4. (Upgrade from [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](../developer/includes/navcorfu_md.md)] and earlier only) If the old database includes test runner codeunits, you will get errors on these codeunits that the OnBeforeTestRun and OnAfterTestRun trigger signatures are not valid. To fix these issues, you change the signature of the OnBeforeTestRun and OnAfterTestRun triggers to include the *TestPermission* parameter.

    For more information, see [Resolving OnBeforeTestRun and OnAfterTestRun Trigger Errors When Converting a Database](Resolve-OnBeforeTestRun-OnAfterTestRun-Compile-Errors.md).

    The triggers for codeunit **130400 CAL Test Runner** and **130402 CAL Command Line Test Runner** will be updated for you during the data upgrade.

## Task 10: (Upgrade from Dynamics NAV 2018 or Business Central Fall 2018 only ) Increase the application version of converted database

You must increase the application version that is assigned to the database.

Use the [Set-NAVApplication](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navapplication) cmdlet of the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] to increase the application version number of the database from its current version.

To see the current version, use the following command:

```
Get-NAVApplication -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName>
```

To increase the version by 1, run the following command:

```
Set-NAVApplication -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -IncrementApplicationVersion
```

Or, to specify change to another version, run the following command:

```
Set-NAVApplication -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -ApplicationVersion <N.N.N.N> -Force
```

For example, if the old version was `11.0.24279.0`, then you could change the version to `14.0.24279.0`.

## <a name="RunSync1"></a> Task 11: Run the schema synchronization on converted database

Synchronize the database schema with validation.

For example, run the [Sync-NAVTenant](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/sync-navtenant) cmdlet from the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)]. 

```
Sync-NAVTenant -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName>
```

When completed, the tenant (database) should have the status **OperationalDataUpgradePending**. To verify this, run the following cmdlet:

```
Get-NAVTenant -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -tenant default
```

For more information, see [Synchronizing the Tenant Database and Application Database](../administration/synchronize-tenant-database-and-application-database.md).

## <a name="RunStartNavUpgrade"></a>Task 12: Run data upgrade on converted database
  
A data upgrade runs the upgrade toolkit objects, such as upgrade codeunits and upgrade tables, to migrate business data from the old table structure to the new table structure. You can start the data upgrade from the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)].  

Open the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] as an administrator, and then run [Start-NavDataUpgrade](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/start-navdataupgrade) cmdlet as follows:  

```  
Start-NavDataUpgrade -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName>  
```  

Replace `<ServerInstanceName>` with the name of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance that is connected to the database.

> [!NOTE]  
>  In the last phase of data upgrade, all companies will be initialized by running codeunit 2 Company Initialization. This is done automatically. If you want to skip company initialization, then use the `Start-NavDataUpgrade` with the `-SkipCompanyIntitialization` parameter. 

To view the progress of the data upgrade, you can run Get-NavDataUpgrade cmdlet with the `–Progress` switch.  

The data upgrade process runs `CheckPreconditions` and `Upgrade` functions in the upgrade codeunits. If any of the preconditions are not met or an upgrade function fails, you must correct the error and resume the data upgrade process. If CheckPreconditions and Upgrade functions are executed successfully, codeunit 2 is automatically run to initialize all companies in the database unless you set the `-SkipCompanyIntitialization` parameter.

## <a name="JSaddins"></a>Task 13: Upgrade Javascript-based control add-ins to new versions

The [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] installation includes new versions of Microsoft-provided Javascript-based control add-ins, such as the Business Chart control add-in. If you application is using any of these add-ins, you must upgrade them to the new versions as follow:

1. Open the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] client.

    If the application uses the Business Chart control add-in, you will get an error about **High Charts**. Upgrading the Business Chart control add-in will clear this error. 
2. Search for and open the **Control Add-ins** page.

    The page lists all the registered control add-ins.
3. Choose **Actions** > **Control Add-in Resource** > **Import**.
4. Locate and select the .zip file for the control add-in and choose **Open**.

    The .zip files are located in the **Add-ins** folder of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] installation. There is a sub-folder for each add-in. For example, the path to the Business Chart control add-in is `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\140\Service\Add-ins\BusinessChart\Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.BusinessChart.zip`.
5. After you have imported all the new control add-in versions, restart Web Server instance.

<!--
##  <a name="AddControlAddins"></a> Task 16: Register client control add-ins
 
The database is now fully upgraded and is ready for use. However, [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] includes the following client control add-ins.
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.BusinessChart  
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.DynamicsOnlineConnect
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.FlowIntegration
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.OAuthIntegration
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.PageReady  
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.PingPong  
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.PowerBIManagement
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.RoleCenterSelector
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.SocialListening  
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.TimelineVisualization
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.VideoPlayer  
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.WebPageViewer
-   Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.WelcomeWizard

To use these add-ins, they must be registered in table **2000000069 Client Add-in**. Depending on the version that you upgraded from, all the add-ins might not be registered after the upgrade process. You can register missing control add-ins in the **Control Add-ins** page in the client. The assemblies (.dlls) for these add-ins are in subfolders to the **Add-ins** folder of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] installation, which by default is [!INCLUDE[prodinstallpath](../developer/includes/prodinstallpath.md)]\Service\Add-ins. For more information, see [How to: Register a Windows Client Control Add-in](/dynamics-nav/How-to--Register-a-Windows-Client-Control-Add-in).

##  Task 14: Publish and generate symbols for extensions

Complete this task if you are upgrading one of the following:

- [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](../developer/includes/nav2018_md.md)] deployment that uses V2 extensions.
- Denmark (DK) version of [!INCLUDE[nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)] or earlier
- German (DE) version of Dynamics NAV or [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] October 2018 (Cumulative Update 2 or earlier)

In this task, you will publish and generate symbols that are required for using V2 extensions. Symbols are the application programming interface between AL code and C/AL code. Symbols enable the ability to reference C/AL objects from AL objects. Symbols are provided as an extension package, and are published to the server instance, but not installed on tenants. There are three types of symbols: system, application, and test. System symbols contained references to the platform system objects. The application symbols contained references to the business application objects. The test symbols contained references to the test libraries used by Microsoft extensions.

1. To get list of the extensions currently published symbols, run the following command from the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)]:
    
    ```
    Get-NAVAppinfo -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -SymbolsOnly
    ```
2. Unpublish the existing system, test, and application symbols by using the [Unpublish-NAVAPP cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/unpublish-navapp):
       
    ```
    Unpublish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <name> -Version <n.n.n.n>
    ```
3. <a name="PublishSymbols"></a>Publish the system.app and test.app symbol files.

    If you installed the **AL Development Environment**, you can find the symbol files where your installed the environment, which by default is [!INCLUDE[prodx86installpath](../developer/includes/prodx86installpath.md)]. Otherwise, you can find the files in the **ModernDev** folder on the installation media. 

    To publish the symbols, open the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] as an administrator, and run the following command for each of the symbol files:

    ```
    Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Path <SymbolFilePath> -PackageType SymbolsOnly
    ```

4. <a name="GenerateSymbols"></a>Generate the application symbol references by using the finsql.exe file as follows:

    1. Make sure that **Enable loading application symbol references at server startup** (EnableSymbolLoadingAtServerStartup) is set on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.

        For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](../administration/configure-server-instance.md).
    2. Open a command prompt as an administrator, change to the directory where the `finsql.exe` file has been installed as part of [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], and then run the following command:

        ```
        finsql.exe Command=generatesymbolreference, Database="<MyDatabaseName>", ServerName=<DatabaseServerName>\<DatabaseInstance>
        ```

        Replace values for the `Database` and `ServerName` settings to suit.

        If the application database contains test objects (ID 130000-139999), then make sure to exclude these objects when generating symbols. You can do this by using the `-Filter` parameter and running the command twice:

        ```
        finsql.exe command=generatesymbolreference, ServerName=<DatabaseServerName>\<DatabaseInstance>, Database="<MyDatabaseName>, filter="Object ID=1..129999"
        ```

        ```
        finsql.exe command=generatesymbolreference, ServerName=<DatabaseServerName>\<DatabaseInstance>, Database="<MyDatabaseName>, filter="Object ID=140000..1999999999"
        ```

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  This command does not generate a file. It populates the **Object Metadata** table in the database.

    3. When you run the command, the console returns to an empty command prompt, and does not display or provide any indication about the status of the run. However, the finsql.exe may still be running in the background. It can take several minutes for the run to complete, and the symbols will not be generated until such time. You can see whether the finsql.exe is still running by using Task Manager and looking on the **Details** tab for **finsql.exe**. 
    
        When the process ends, a file named **navcommandresult.txt** is saved to the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)] installation folder. If the command succeeded, the file will contain text like `[0] [06/12/17 14:36:17] The command completed successfully in '177' seconds.` If the command failed, another file named **naverrorlog.txt** will be generated. This file contains details about the error(s) that occurred. 
            
    For more information about generation symbols, see [Running C/SIDE and AL Side-by-Side](../developer/devenv-running-cside-and-al-side-by-side.md).

    4. Restart the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.

##  <a name="AddExtensions"></a> Task 15: Upgrade or repair V2 extensions

Complete this task if you are upgrading from a [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](../developer/includes/nav2018_md.md)] deployment that uses V2 extensions. In this step, you will upgrade the V2 extensions that you previously uninstalled. The upgrade process will reinstall these extensions.

The [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] installation media (DVD) includes several new versions of Microsoft extensions (that is, extensions that have **Microsoft** as the publisher). If your old deployment uses these extensions, you have to upgrade the current versions to the new versions.

1. To get list of the extensions currently published on the application, run the following command from the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)]:

    ```
    Get-NAVAppinfo -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName>
    ```
2. Upgrade the Microsoft extensions that were published in the old deployment to new versions. 

    The new extension versions are found in the `\Extensions` folder of the installation media (DVD). Follow these steps for each extension by using the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)]:

    1. Publish the new extension version by running the [Publish-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/publish-navapp) cmdlet: 

        ```
        Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Path <ExtensionFileName> 
        ```
           
    2.  Synchronize the schema with the database by running the [Sync-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp) cmdlet:

        ```    
        Sync-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
        ```
    3. Upgrade the data of the extensions.

        To run the data upgrade, run the [Start-NAVAppDataUpgrade](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/start-navappdataupgrade) cmdlet:

        ```
        Start-NAVAppDataUpgrade -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
        ``` 

        Apart from upgrading the data, this command will install the new extension version.

    For more information about publishing extensions, see [Publish and Install an Extension](../developer/devenv-how-publish-and-install-an-extension-v2.md).

3. Repair, synchronize, and install other currently published extension versions that you still want to use, but have not been upgraded to new versions. 

    For each extension, complete the following steps from the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)]: 

    1. Compile the extension to make it work with the new platform by running the [Repair-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/repair-navapp) cmdlet.

        ```
        Repair-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Extension Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
        ```
   2. Synchronize the schema with the database by running the [Sync-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp) cmdlet:

        ```    
        Sync-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
        ```
    3. Install the extension by running the [Install-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/install-navapp) cmdlet:

        ```    
        Install-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
        ```
   
7. (Optional) Unpublish unused extension versions by running the [Unpublish-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/unpublish-navapp): 
         
    ```
    Unpublish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
    ```

## Task 16: Publish and install local functionality extensions

Complete this task if you are upgrading one of the following:

- Denmark (DK) version of [!INCLUDE[nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)] or earlier
- German (DE) version of Dynamics NAV or [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] October 2018 (Cumulative Update 2 or earlier)

With these language versions, some of the local functionality has been moved from the base application to extensions. These extensions will have to be published and installed to maintain the functionality. The extensions are avilable on the installation media (DVD). 

If you are upgrading from a Denmark (DK) version, you must publish and install the following extensions to get the local functionality:

|Name|Extension package|
|----|---------|
|OIOUBL |OIOUBL.app|
|Payroll Data Import Definitions (DK)| ImportDKPayroll.app| 
|Payment and Reconciliation Formats (DK)|FIK.app |
|Tax File Formats (DK)| VATReportsDK.app|

If you are upgrading from a German (DE) version you must publish and install the following extensions to get the local functionality:

|Name|Extension package|
|----|---------|
|ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany| Elster.app|

Follow these steps for each extension by using the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)]:

1. Publish the new extension version by running the [Publish-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/publish-navapp) cmdlet: 

    ```
    Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Path <ExtensionFileName> 
    ```
    The new extension versions are found in the `\Extensions` folder of the installation media (DVD).

 2. Synchronize the schema with the database by running the [Sync-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp) cmdlet:

    ```    
    Sync-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
    ```
3. Install the newly published local functionality extensions by running the [Install-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/install-navapp) cmdlet:

    ```    
    Install-NAVApp -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -Name <Name> -Version <N.N.N.N>
    ```

## <a name="ImportPerms"></a> Task 17: Import permission sets and permissions

Import the permission sets and permissions XML files that you exported from the old database as follows:

- Upgrade from [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)]:

    1. Open table **2000000004 Permission Sets** in the client, and delete all permission sets except SUPER.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You are only required to delete those permission sets that are also included in the permission sets XML file that you will import. Because if you try to import a permission set with the same name as one already in the database, you will get an error. 
    2. Run XMLport **9171** and XMLport **9172** to import the permission sets and permission XML files.

        For more information, see [How to: Export and Import Permission Sets and Permissions](how-to--import-export-permission-sets-permissions.md#ImportPerms).

- Upgrade from an earlier [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] version:

    1. In the client, search for and open the **Permission Sets** page.
    2. Delete all user-defined permissions.
    3. Choose **Import Permission Sets**, then select the permissions set file that you exported previously.

        This action runs the XMLPort **9174 Import Tenant Permissions**.

## <a name="UploadEncryptionKeys"></a>Task 18: \(Optional\) Import data encryption key

If you want to use data encryption as before, you must import the data encryption key file that was exported previously.  

For more information, see [Exporting and Importing Encryption Keys](how-to-export-and-import-encryption-keys.md).

## <a name="SetLang"></a>Task 19: Set the language of customer database

In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long_md](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], choose **Tools**, choose **Language**, and then select the language of the original customer database.  
 
## Task 20: (Optional) Update Web Server instance configuration file

If you have installed the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)], populate the navsettings.json file for the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] instance with the settings of the old web.config file or navsettings.json.

- If the old deployment used a web.config file, then you have to manually change the settings in the navsetting.json file that is used on the new [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] instance.

- If you upgraded from [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] October 2018, you can replace the navsettings.json file on the new [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] instance with the old file. However, as of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] April 2019, the following  settings are now configured under a root element called `ApplicationIdSettings` instead of the root element `NAVWebSettings`.

    - `AndroidPrivacy`
    - `AndroidSoftwareLicenseTerms`
    - `AndroidThirdPartyNotice`
    - `BaseHelpUrl`
    - `BaseSettingsSectionName`
    - `CommunityLink`
    - `FeedbackLink`
    - `IosPrivacy`
    - `IosSoftwareLicenseTerms`
    - `IosThirdPartyNotice`
    - `KeyboardShortcutsLink`
    - `PrivacyLink`
    - `LegalLink`
    - `SignInHelpLink`

    If the old navsettings.json file uses any of these settings, then you will have to move them from the `NAVWebSettings` element to the `ApplicationIdSettings` element.

For more information about the navsettings.json file, see [Configuring Business Central Web Server Instances](../administration/configure-web-server.md).
  
## <a name="DeleteUpgCodeunits"></a>(Optional) Task 21: Delete upgrade objects

At this point, you have upgraded the database to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. Now, you can delete the upgrade codeunits and upgrade table objects that you imported in task 9. This task is recommended but not required.  

When you delete tables, on the **Delete** dialog box, set the **Synchronize Schema** option to **Force**.
