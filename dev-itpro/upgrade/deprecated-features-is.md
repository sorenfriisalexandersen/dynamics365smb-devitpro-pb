# Deprecated Features in the Icelandic Version of [!INCLUDE [prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Iceland that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Icelandic Tax Regulations of Conditional Discounts
The local tax regulation of conditional discounts feature enables you to issue a credit memo if a conditional discount is given to a customer. The payment for a conditional discount must be made within a specified period.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| This feature is no longer specific to Iceland, so we have made it generally available in the standard product. There is a field for number series for credit invoices on the **Sales and Receivables Setup** form, and a field on the **Customer Ledger Entry** table to link the appropriate entries to a credit invoice. |
