# Upgrading to [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]

This section provides an overview of how to upgrade to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. The upgrade process depends on different factors, including on your decision to deploy [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] on-premises or move your solution online.  

> [!TIP]
> Before you decide how to upgrade your solution, make sure that you read the upgrade considerations at [Important Information and Considerations for Before Upgrading to [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]](Upgrade-Considerations.md).  

Depending on your decision to upgrade to either [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] online or on-premises, different scenarios are supported. Read the upgrade considerations, and then revise the supported scenarios in the respective sections.
