# Ruleset for the Code Analysis Tool 
In an AL project, you can use a custom ruleset file to specify how code analysis will report the issues it encounters. Different settings can affect how rules are applied and each ruleset file name must follow the pattern `<name>.ruleset.json` to benefit from IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code.

> [!NOTE] 
> Use the `truleset` and `trule` snippets provided by the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] to create your ruleset.

The following table describes the schema of a ruleset object:

|Setting|Mandatory|Type|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|-----|
|name|Yes|String|The name of the ruleset.|
|description|No|String|The description of the ruleset. You can use this to document the purpose of the ruleset.|
|generalAction|No|Error&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Warning&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Info&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Hidden|The action to apply to all the diagnostics that have rules defined in this file or in other files that have a **Default** action specified and to all the diagnostics generated by the current set of analyzers that do not have a rule defined. If an included file has a stricter **generalAction**, that one will be used.|
|includedRuleSets|No|Array of **IncludedRuleSet**|List of external ruleset files to include in the current ruleset. The order in which the files are processed is undefined.|
|rules|No|Array of **Rule**|Collection of rules to apply to diagnostics generated by analyzers.|

An **IncludedRuleSet** is a complex JSON object that defines the inclusion of an external ruleset file in the current ruleset, and has the following properties:  

|Setting|Mandatory|Type|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|-----|   
|path|Yes|String|The path to the included file. For includes specified in the file to which the **al.ruleSetPath** is set, the path can be absolute or relative to the project folder. For files included from the root ruleset file, the path is relative to the file. Adding an entry to the ruleset path and saving it will automatically be applied to all projects that are using the ruleset.|    
|action|Yes|Error&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Warning&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Info&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Hidden&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;None&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Default|The action to apply for all the diagnostics that have an action specified in the included ruleset that is different from **None** and **Hidden**.|

A **Rule** is a complex JSON object that specifies how you can process a specific diagnostic. A **Rule** object has the following properties:     


|Setting|Mandatory|Type|Value|     
|-------|---------|-----|-----|     
|id|Yes|String|The string that uniquely identifies a diagnostic.|      
|action|Yes|Error&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Warning&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Info&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;Hidden&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;None|The action to apply if the diagnostic is emitted. There cannot be two rules with the same id and different actions in the same rule file.|

## Examples
The following example shows a ruleset that sets the severity of rule **AA0001 : There must be exactly one space character on each side of a binary operator such as := + - AND OR =.** provided by the **CodeCop** analyzer to **Error**.
```
{
    "name": "Company ruleset",
    "description": "These rules must be respected by all the AL code written within the company.",
    "rules": [
        {
            "id": "AA0001",
            "action": "Error",
            "justification": "This diagnostic helps to improve readability. It must be respected in all cases."
        }
    ]
}
```

The following example shows a project-specific ruleset that extends a company-wide ruleset contained in the file **company.ruleset.json** and sets the severity of the rule **AA0005 : Only use BEGIN..END to enclose compound statements.** provided by the **CodeCop** analyzer to **Info**.

```
{
    "name": "Personal Project ruleset",
    "description": "A list of project specific rules",
    "includedRuleSets": [
        {
            "action": "Default",
            "path": "./company.ruleset.json"
        }
    ],
    "rules": [
        {
            "id": "AA0005",
            "action": "Info",
            "justification": "For this specific project, this diagnostic should be informational."
        }
    ]
}
```
