# Working with Sandboxes and Entitlements
The experience that a user has in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] depends on the purchased subscription plan. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], there are two main plans; the Essential and the Premium plan, plus a few more. For more detailed information about the Essential and Premium plans, see [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing site. 

When you develop in a Docker sandbox, the Essential experience is automatically assigned to you (you set the experience on the **Company Information** page), which makes it difficult to test how a user with the Premium plan assigned will experience what you have developed.
<br>

## Setup for users with different plans
To mimic users with a specific subscription plan assigned, you can set them up with the user groups as detailed in the table below. When you add user to the group, the permission sets defined for the group will apply to the user. For more information, see [To group users in user groups](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-define-granular-permissions?branch=master#to-manage-permissions-through-user-groups).

> [!NOTE]  
> In the table below *non-default* means not assigned by default, but the plan allows this to be assigned to the user.

## Assigning the Premium plan to test users
Depending on how you are running your Docker sandbox, you assign the experience in different ways.

### Azure VMs
If you use [https://aka.ms/bcsandbox](https://aka.ms/bcsandbox) to create your [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Sandbox Container Azure VM, the Azure Resource Manager template has two fields; **Assign Premium Plan** and **Create Test Users**, which by default are set to **Yes**.

**Assign Premium Plan** specifies whether or not your admin user should be assigned a Premium plan. **Create Test Users** specifies whether or not you want the setup to include test users. 

### NavContainerHelper
If you are using `New-NavContainer` to create your [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Sandbox container, you must make sure that you are using version 0.2.8.3 or later.

Use the switch `assignPremiumPlan` on `New-NavContainer` like this:

```
New-NavContainer -accept_eula -assignPremiumPlan -containerName test -imageName microsoft/bcsandbox
```

This assigns the Premium plan to your default admin user. Internally this just adds a record to the **User Plan** table.

To create the test users, you must call the `Setup-NavContainerTestUsers` method:

```
Setup-NavContainerTestUsers containerName test -tenant default -password $securePassword
```

specifying the container and the password that you want to use for the new users.

Internally, the `Setup-NavContainerTestUsers` downloads an app which exposes an API, publishes and installs the app, and then invokes the `CreateTestUsers` API with the password needed. After this, the app is uninstalled and unpublished.

If you want to see code behind the app, it is available [here](https://dev.azure.com/businesscentralapps/CreateTestUsers).

### Docker run
If you are using Docker run to run your containers, you have a little more work to do.

First of all, you must override the `SetupNavUsers.ps1` by sharing a local folder to `c:\run\my` in the container and place a file called `SetupNavUsers.ps1` in that folder with the following content:

```
# Invoke default behavior
. (Join-Path $runPath $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name)
 
Get-NavServerUser -serverInstance NAV -tenant default |? LicenseType -eq "FullUser" | % {
    $UserId = $_.UserSecurityId
    Write-Host "Assign Premium plan for $($_.Username)"
    sqlcmd -S 'localhostSQLEXPRESS' -d $DatabaseName -Q "INSERT INTO [dbo].[User Plan] ([Plan ID],[User Security ID]) VALUES ('{8e9002c0-a1d8-4465-b952-817d2948e6e2}','$userId')" | Out-Null
}
```

This will assign the Premium plan to the admin user in the database.

> [!TIP]  
> To set up test users, you can clone the [createtestusers](https://dev.azure.com/businesscentralapps/CreateTestUsers) repository and modify the code to create the users on the `oninstall` trigger with the password that you want.
