| General requirements | Description| Requirements |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------|

See in the list below what to consider for each storefront detail when it comes to language: 

|Description | Requirements |
|------------|---------------|
|Offer name:| Must be English |
|Summary:| Can be in any one language, not more because of length constraints.|
|Description:| Can be in multiple languages (max 3) but must be the same content for each language. If English is not one of the languages chosen, an English document must be added.|
|Screenshots:| Can be in any language|
|Videos:|Can be in any language, no captioning required, however English captioning recommended|
|Documents:| If description is not in English, a document with description in English is required. Rest of documents can be in any language.|

|Support / Help:| Can be in any language. Recommended in English. |
|Privacy:| If hosted on partner website, can be any language.|
|Licensing:| Must be in English if hosted on AppSource, can be in any language if hosted on partner website.|
|Supported countries:| Must be in English and using the provided standard html code.|
|Supported editions:| Must be in English and using the provided standard html code.|

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are targeting an international audience, we still recommend you use English on AppSource and create different landing pages incorporating the needed languages (i.e. two language buttons – cf. one in English and one in the given local language)

| General requirements | Description  | Requirements |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0.B **Branding** (How to reference the Microsoft brand correctly) | Be consistent with the branding throughout your communications: Throughout all your sales, communication and marketing materials, all references (spoken and written in videos, docs, app landing page, screenshots, title bars etc.) must refer to the correct branding and UI, cf. either **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.  | Required |


Make sure to make the right reference throughout your content:
- Based on the ”new” branding guidelines, the full name, "**Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**" must be used in its entirety at first mention on the page, and at all prominent locations such as titles, headings etc. (unless the Microsoft brand is already clearly established)
- **Dynamics 365 Business Central** on second mention (or first mention if the Microsoft brand is already clearly established)
- **Business Central** on subsequent mention as long as Microsoft Dynamics 365 has been clearly established on that given page or content. 

Please reference [Microsoft Dynamics 365 branding rules documentation](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2858&topicid=44517 ).
- Don’t include Microsoft names, logos or trademarks in your offer unless it is the [AppSource badge](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/new-get-it-from-badging-for-microsoft-appsource-and-azure-marketplace-available-in-the-marketing-resources-guide) 
- Don’t use Dynamics 365 names, logos or trademarks in your offering’s: name, URL, your company name, your social media account names or any other names you might use.
- Don’t make references to acronyms, old brand names or demo old UIs

Don’t make any references in any text, screenshots, title bars, Webclient, spoken language in videos, documentation, app landing pages etc. to:
- Acronyms: “NAV”, “FOBE” or “D365” 
- Old brands: “for financials”, “for Finance & Operations” 
- Screenshots and demos of old Dynamics 365 UIs

Referencing above acronyms, old brand names and old UIs will make your app fail marketing validation promptly.

> [!NOTE]  
> All content, videos, screenshots etc. must list the product name as **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. Only when the two previous mentioned options are established is it appropriate to use **Business Central** by itself. Don't use acroynms, shorten the name or abbreviate it or use old product names. Always use the most current version of Dynamics 365 Business Central in screenshots, videos etc. Not permitted BC, D365 or any other variation. When in doubt, only use **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. Limit usage of **Business Central** by itself so that the product branding can be clearly defined and consistent throughout content.
