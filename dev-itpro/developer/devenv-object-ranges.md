# Object Ranges in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] running in the cloud, there are three different object ranges in terms of licensing. Developing for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] is done using Visual Studio Code with the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)]. All tenants in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] are able to freely use objects in the following ranges:

- 50.000-99.999
- 1.000.000-69.999.999
- 70.000.000-74.999.999

In the following each individual range is explained.

## 0-49.999
This range is assigned to [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] base app functionality and must not be used.

## 50.000-99.999 
This range is for customizations. A partner can develop an extension tailored to the individual tenant to fit the needs. The partner will develop this either by using a sandbox tenant or by obtaining a Docker image of the current release of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] that matches the version of the tenant. Once the development is done, the extension can be deployed to the individual tenant.

## 100.000-999.999
The objects in this range are mainly designed when the Microsoft team localizes [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] for a specific country or region. These objects cannot be used by partners.

## 1.000.000-69.999.999
This is the Registered Solution Program (RSP) range which partners that have an ISV solution for on-premise have access to. The partner can choose to use this range for developing extensions that can be used either in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] on-premise or in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] in the cloud. When used in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] these extensions are obtained as apps from [appsource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com).

## 70.000.000-74.999.999
Partners can obtain ranges for extension development that runs in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] in the cloud. This range is only available for extension development and only in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. These extensions are obtained as apps from [appsource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com).
