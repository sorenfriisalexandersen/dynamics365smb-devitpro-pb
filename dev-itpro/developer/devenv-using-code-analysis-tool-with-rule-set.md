# Using the Code Analysis Tools with the Ruleset
This topic shows how you can use a custom ruleset to customize the severity of diagnostics produced by the code analysis tools that are part of the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] for Visual Studio Code.

## Using rulesets with code analysis
First, create a simple project in AL. 
1. Press **Alt + A, Alt + L** to create a new project.
2. Open the Command Palette by using the **Ctrl+Shift+P** shortcut and choose either User Settings or Workspace Settings.
3. Copy the setting `al.enableCodeAnalysis` to the settings.json file and set it to `true`: `"al.enableCodeAnalysis": true`.
4. Copy the setting `al.codeanalyzers` to the settings file and then use **Ctrl+Space** to pick from the available code analyzers. Separate the list of code analyzers with commas. For more information about the available analyzers, see [AppSourceCop](analyzers/appsourcecop.md), [CodeCop](analyzers/codecop.md), [PerTenantExtensionCop](analyzers/pertenantextensioncop.md), and [UICop](analyzers/uicop.md).

At this point, the selected analyzers will be run on your project. Next, add some code to the project that will, in the following example, be used to demonstrate violations of the AA0001 **"There must be exactly one space character on each side of a binary operator such as := + - AND OR =."** code analysis rule. 

## Add your own code to the project
In the Visual Studio Code Explorer, open the `HelloWorld.al` file and replace the existing code with the following:

```
pageextension 50100 CustomerListExt extends "Customer List"
{
    trigger OnOpenPage();
    var
        result: Integer;
    begin        
        // The following line will trigger the warning
        // AA0001 "There must be exactly one space character on each side 
        // of a binary operator such as := + - AND OR =." 
        result := 2+2; 
        Message('2 + 2 = ' + Format(result));
    end;
}
```

On the **View** tab of Visual Studio Code, select the **Problems** option and you will see a warning with the message **"There must be exactly one space character on each side of '+'."**. In this case, the problem can be fixed by running the AL Formatter command. For more information, see [AL Formatter](devenv-al-formatter.md).

## Creating and customizing a ruleset
To create and customize a ruleset of your own, follow the next steps:

1. On the **File** tab in Visual Studio Code, choose **New File**.
2. Save the empty file with a name, for example `<name>.ruleset.json` and make a note of the file path.
3. Add the following code to the `<name>.ruleset.json` file:

    ```
    {
        "name": "My Custom ruleset",
        "rules": [
            {                    
                "id": "AA0001",                    
                "action": "None"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
4. In your project settings set **al.ruleSetPath** to the path to the `<name>.ruleset.json` file, relative to the project root. For more information about custom rules, see [ruleset for the Code Analysis tool](devenv-rule-set-syntax-for-code-analysis-tools.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `truleset` and `trule` snippets provided by the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] to create your ruleset. The ruleset will be applied to all the analyzers enabled for the current project. For more information about selectively enabling analyzers, see [Using the Code Analysis Tools](devenv-using-code-analysis-tool.md).

## Running the code analysis
The code analysis will run in the background and you will see the warning **"There must be exactly one space character on each side of '+'."** disappear from the **Problems** option in Visual Studio Code.

To trigger a new compilation manually, use the **Ctrl+Shift+B** shortcut to build your project. For more information about AL keyboard shortcuts, see [Keyboard shortcuts](devenv-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## Limitations
Changing the contents of the ruleset file will not be detected by the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)]. To see the effects of changing the ruleset file, you can try any of the following:
- Reload the window.
- In the project settings, change the **al.ruleSetPath** setting to an invalid path. Save the settings file, change back the setting, and save it.
<!-- - In the project settings file, make changes to one of the settings, such as **al.ruleSetPath**, and save it. You can then undo the changes. -->
