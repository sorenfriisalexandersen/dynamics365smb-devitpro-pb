# Scope Attribute
Specifies the scope of a method. The attribute has two options `OnPrem` and `Cloud`. The default option for a method is `[Scope('Cloud')]`, which means that the method can be accessed from Web services. 

> [!NOTE]  
> In previous versions `OnPrem` was equivalent to `Internal` and `Cloud` was equivalent to `External`. Both `Internal` and `External` options are being deprecated.

## Syntax  
```  
[Scope('OnPrem')]
```
  
## Example
Setting the attribute on a method. Each method must be marked with `[Scope('OnPrem')]`.

```
procedure MyProcedureForCloud()
    begin
        Message('My procedure is available externally.');    
    end;

[Scope('OnPrem')]
procedure MyProcedureForOnPrem()
    begin
        Message('My procedure is available internally.');    
    end;

```
