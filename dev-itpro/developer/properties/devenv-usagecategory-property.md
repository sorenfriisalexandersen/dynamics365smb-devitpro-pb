# UsageCategory Property
AL provides navigational support for pages and reports in the client. You enable a page or report to be discoverable through **Tell me** in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] by using the **UsageCategory** property. For more information, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Tell Me](../devenv-al-menusuite-functionality.md).

## Property Values
The values for the **UsageCategory** property are listed below. The **UsageCategory** property makes the page or report searchable and further sub categorizes it in the list of search results when the user has used the **Tell me** functionality.

|Value           |Description                                  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|None            |The page or report is not included in a search.|
|Lists           |The page or report is listed as **Lists** under the **Pages and Tasks** category.|
|Tasks           |The page or report is listed as **Tasks** under the **Pages and Tasks** category.|
|ReportsAndAnalysis |The page or report is listed as **Reports and Analysis** under the **Reports and Analysis** category.|
|Documents       |The page or report is listed as **Documents** under the **Reports and Analysis** category.|
|History         |The page or report is listed as **Archive** under the **Reports and Analysis** category.|
|Administration  |The page or report is listed as **Administration** under the **Pages and Tasks** category.|

## Remarks
If the **UsageCategory** is set to **None**, or if you do not specify **UsageCategory**, the page or report will not show up when you use the search functionality. 

## Syntax

```
UsageCategory = ReportsAndAnalysis;  
```

## Dependent Properties
The [AccessByPermission property](devenv-accessbypermission-property.md) and [ApplicationArea Property](devenv-applicationarea-property.md) are optional properties, which can be applied to set restrictions on an object accessibility, when you add the **UsageCategory** property.
