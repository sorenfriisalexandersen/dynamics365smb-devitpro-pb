# ConstValue Property
Sets the value of the AL text constant for the current application language of the [!INCLUDE[d365_dev_short_md](../includes/d365_dev_short_md.md)].  
  
## Applies To  
 **Local** and **global** text constants in the AL code of objects.  

## Syntax
```
ConstValue = Name;
```

## Remarks  
 The **ConstValue** property sets the text string in the [ConstValueML Property](devenv-constvalueml-property.md) for the current application language of the [!INCLUDE[d365_dev_short_md](../includes/d365_dev_short_md.md)]. For example, if the application language of the [!INCLUDE[d365_dev_short_md](../includes/d365_dev_short_md.md)] is set to English (United States) and you set the **ConstValue** property to **test**, then the value **ENU=test** is included in the **ConstValueML** property.
