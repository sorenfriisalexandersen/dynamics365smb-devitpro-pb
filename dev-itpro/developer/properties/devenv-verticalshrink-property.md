# VerticalShrink Property
Specifies whether the control add-in can dynamically decrease its height. This setting is optional. 

> [!NOTE]
> Use this property when the visual content of the add-in is designed to remain usable when height is restricted.

## Applies to
VerticalShrink is only supported when the control add-in is displayed on a CardPart on Role Center pages or when it is the only content displayed on a Card page.
  
## Property Values 
**True** if the control add-in is allowed to shrink vertically. The default value is **false**. 

## Remarks
VerticalShrink is typically used together with the [MinimumHeight](devenv-minimumheight-property.md) property. If VerticalShrink is **true** but [MinimumHeight](devenv-minimumheight-property.md) is not set, the control add-in can shrink to nothing.
When the add-in shrinks in size, the visual content must remain visible and accessible to users. To provide the best experience, consider implementing a responsive design that can adapt to reduced space and vertical scrollbars.

  
## Code Example
```
RequestedHeight = 300;
VerticalShrink = true;
MinimumHeight = 150;
```
