# HorizontalShrink Property

Specifies whether the control add-in can dynamically decrease its width. This setting is optional.

> [!NOTE]
> Use this property when the visual content of the add-in is designed to remain usable when width is restricted.

## Applies to
- Control add-in objects
    
## Property Values
**True** if the control add-in is allowed to shrink horizontally. The default value is **false**.

## Remarks
HorizontalShrink is typically used together with the [MinimumWidth](devenv-minimumwidth-property.md) property. If HorizontalShrink is **true** but [MinimumWidth](devenv-minimumwidth-property.md) is not set, the control add-in can shrink to nothing.
When the add-in shrinks in size, the visual content must remain visible and accessible to users. To provide the best experience, consider implementing a responsive design that can adapt to reduced space and horizontal scrollbars.

## Code Example
```
RequestedWidth = 600;
HorizontalShrink = true;
MinimumWidth = 100;

```
