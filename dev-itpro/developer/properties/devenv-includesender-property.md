# IncludeSender Property
Specifies whether global methods in the object that contains the event publisher method are exposed to event subscriber methods that subscribe to the event.  
  
## Applies to  
  
-   AL Methods  
  
     This property is only available when the [Event Property](devenv-event-property.md) is set to **Publisher**.  
  
## Property Value  
 **True** to expose the global methods in the object that contains the event publisher method to event subscriber methods; otherwise, **false**. The default value is **false**.  

## Syntax
```
IncludeSender = true;
```
  
## Remarks  
 Setting the property to **true** enables you to call global methods in the object that contains the event publisher method from event subscriber methods that subscribe to the published event.  
  
 When you set the property to **true**, the signature of event subscriber methods that subscribe to the published event automatically include a VAR parameter for the published event object, as shown in the following example:  
  
 `LOCAL [EventSubscriber] CheckAddressLine(VAR Sender : Codeunit "My Publisher Object")`
