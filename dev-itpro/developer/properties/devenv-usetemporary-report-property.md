# UseTemporary Property (Report)
Sets whether a temporary table is used to store the data set that is returned for columns of a data item.

## Applies To  

- Report data items

## Property Value  
**True** to use a temporary table; otherwise, **false**. The default value is **false**.  

## Syntax
```
UseTemporary = true;
```

## Remarks  
 A temporary table is used as a buffer or intermediate storage for data. A temporary table is not stored in the database, but is only held in memory until the report is closed. A temporary table is useful when the column data is not mapped directly to a field in the database but is instead the result of a process or operation, such as an aggregation of data from several columns. If a temporary table is not used, the data must be handled by AL code.  
  
For an example of the use of the UseTemporary property, see report 1306 in the [!INCLUDE[demolong](../includes/demolong_md.md)].
