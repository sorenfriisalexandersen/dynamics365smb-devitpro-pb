# Promoted (Action) Property
Sets the value that indicates whether the selected action is promoted, which means that it is elevated to a promoted category in the action bar, as well as the group where is it defined. **Promoted** can also be set on Profiles, see [Promoted (Profiles) Property](devenv-promoted-profile-property.md).
  
## Applies To  
  
- Page actions  
  
## Example
The following code illustrates how to set the **Promoted** property.
 
```
page 50110 PageName
{
    PageType = Card;

    actions
    {
        // Adds the action called "My Actions" to the Action menu 
        area(Processing)
        {
            action("My Actions")
            {
                Promoted = true;
                PromotedCategory = Process;
                ApplicationArea = All;

...
```

## Remarks

This feature allows you to make a copy of an action and place it on the on the action bar where it is easier to find.  
  
Available options are **true**/**false**.
