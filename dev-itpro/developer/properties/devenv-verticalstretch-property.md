# VerticalStretch Property

Specifies whether the control add-in can dynamically increase its height. This setting is optional.

> [!NOTE]
> Use this property when the visual content of the add-in is designed to remain usable when height is increased.

## Applies to
VerticalStretch is only supported when the control add-in is displayed in a CardPart on Role Center pages, or when it is the only content displayed in a Card page.

## Property Values
**True** if the control add-in is allowed to stretch vertically. The default value is **false**.

## Remarks
VerticalStretch is typically used together with the [MaximumHeight](devenv-maximumheight-property.md) property. If VerticalStretch is **true** but [MaximumHeight](devenv-maximumheight-property.md) is not set, the control add-in can stretch indefinitely. 


## Code Example
```
RequestedHeight = 300;
VerticalStretch = true;
MaximumHeight = 500;
```
