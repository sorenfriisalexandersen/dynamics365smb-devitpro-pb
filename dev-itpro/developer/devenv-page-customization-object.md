# Page Customization Object

The page customization object in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] allows you to add changes to the layout and actions on page that are accessible for a profile. 

The page customization object has more restrictions than the [page extension object](devenv-page-ext-object.md); when you define a new page customization object, you cannot add variables, procedures, or triggers. 

> [!NOTE]  
> A single page customization can be used with multiple profiles within the same extension. Page customizations only apply to the RoleCenters they are specified for. In order to view or changes the RoleCenters in the client, go to **My Settings** > **Role Center**. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Extension objects can have a name with a maximum length of 30 characters.     

## Snippet support
Typing the shortcut `tpagecust` will create the basic layout for a page customization object when using the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] in Visual Studio Code.

[!INCLUDE[intelli_shortcut](includes/intelli_shortcut.md)]

## Views
Views in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] are used on list pages to define a different view of the data on a given page. Views can be defined for [Pages](devenv-page-object.md), [Page Extensions](devenv-page-ext-object.md), and [Page Customization](devenv-page-customization-object.md). For more information, see [Views](devenv-views.md).


## Page customization example

The following page customization example `MyCustomization` makes changes to **Customer List**. By using the `moveafter` method, `Blanket Orders` is moved after the `Orders` action item. And the `modify` method is used to hide the `NewSalesBlanketOrder` action item.

```
profile TheBoss
{
    Description = 'The Boss';
    RoleCenter = "Business Manager Role Center";
    Customizations = MyCustomization;
    Caption = 'Boss';
}

pagecustomization MyCustomization customizes "Customer List"
{
    actions
    {
        moveafter(Orders; "Blanket Orders")

        modify(NewSalesBlanketOrder)
        {
            Visible = false;
        }

    }
}
```

You can use the same page customization on another profile within the same extension package by referencing its name from the profile definition, for example:

```
profile TheSalesman
{
    ProfileDescription = 'The Boss';
    RoleCenter = "Sales Manager Role Center";
    Customizations = MyCustomization;
    Caption = 'Salesman';
}
```
