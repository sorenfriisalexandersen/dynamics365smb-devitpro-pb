In the Microsoft Partner Center documentation, you can learn how to [add a customer](/partner-center/add-a-new-customer), [assign licenses to users](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users), and [create new subscriptions](/partner-center/create-a-new-subscription). [!INCLUDE[prodshort](prodshort.md)] is one of the subscriptions that you can create, and there are [!INCLUDE[prodshort](prodshort.md)]-specific license types that you can assign to users.
