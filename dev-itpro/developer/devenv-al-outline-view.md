# AL Outline View
Working with the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] you have access to the **Outline** view. The **Outline** view is a separate section in the lower left corner, right under the **Explorer** view.

The **Outline** view is enabled by default and shows the symbol tree of the currently active cursor, it also allows you to filter as you type. Double-clicking on any node makes your cursor jump to the selected definition or keyword. The **Outline** view will also display any errors in your project for easy inspection.

You manage the look and feel of the **Outline** view by defining a number of settings, that are all enabled by default:

+ `outline.icons` - Outline elements displayed with icons.
+ `outline.problems.enabled` - Show errors and warnings on outline elements.
+ `outline.problems.badges` - Badges displayed for errors and warnings.
+ `outline.problems.colors` - Colors used for errors and warnings.
