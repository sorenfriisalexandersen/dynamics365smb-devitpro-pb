Runs as a page closes after the [OnQueryClosePage Trigger](devenv-onqueryclosepage-trigger.md) is executed.  

## Syntax  
```  
trigger OnClosePage()
begin
    ...
end;
```  

## Applies To  

-   Pages  

<!--NAV
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The OnClosePage trigger is not fully supported by the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../includes/nav_web_md.md)]. When the page displays in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../includes/nav_web_md.md)], the trigger is only invoked when the page is hosted in a modal popup window \(MPO\).

## Remarks  
 This trigger is initiated by a user action, such as when the user chooses the **Close** button, or by the CurrPage.CLOSE  being called.  

 You can write to the database from this trigger.
