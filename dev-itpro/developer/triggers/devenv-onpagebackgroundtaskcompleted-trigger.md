## Example

The following example modifies the `OnPageBackgroundTaskCompleted` trigger to update the page with the started and finished times that were calculated in the page background task, and displays a notification that the times have been updated. For more details about this example, see [Page Background Tasks](../devenv-page-background-tasks.md).

``` 
    trigger OnPageBackgroundTaskCompleted(TaskId: Integer; Results: Dictionary of [Text, Text])
    var
        started: Text;
        waited: Text;
        finished: Text;
        PBTNotification: Notification;
    begin
        if (TaskId = WaitTaskId) then begin
            Evaluate(started, Results.Get('started'));
            Evaluate(waited, Results.Get('waited'));
            Evaluate(finished, Results.Get('finished'));

            before1 := started;
            duration1 := waited;
            after1 := finished;
            PBTNotification.Message('Start and finish times have been updated.');
            PBTNotification.Send();
        end;
    end;
```
