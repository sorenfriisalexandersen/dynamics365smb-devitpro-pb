# OnAfterInsertRecord Trigger
Runs after a record has been inserted into a database table.  
  
## Applies To  
- XMLports  
  
## Remarks  
 This trigger is only used to import data and can be used to move data from temporary tables to real tables.  
  
 If the [AutoSave Property](../properties/devenv-autosave-property.md) is **false**, then although the record is not inserted automatically, the OnAfterInsertRecord trigger is still called after the insertion would have occurred.
