# OnLookup (Fields) Trigger
Causes the system to display a lookup page.  

## Applies To  
- Fields  

## Remarks  
The [Lookup Property](../properties/devenv-lookup-property.md) must be set to **True** to enable the lookup.

 There are three lookup options:  

1. Default Lookup - The lookup into the table is performed without applying filters or other special parameters.  

2. Field Lookup - You can use this trigger to define a field lookup that will be used in place of the default lookup.  

3. Text box Lookup - You can use the [OnLookup \(Page fields\) Trigger](devenv-onlookup-page-fields-trigger.md) to define a lookup based on the value of a text box. This value will be used in place of the default lookup or the field lookup.  

 When using this trigger, follow this approach:  

- Use the field value to determine what filters or other parameters to apply.  

- Run the lookup page as a modal page.  

- Transfer the value the user selects back to the field when the user chooses **OK**.  

 If an error occurs in the trigger code, the lookup page is closed.  

<!--NAV  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On non-editable fields in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)], the field gets its lookup action rendered as a hyperlink. In the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../includes/nav_web_md.md)] the lookup for a non-editable field is not rendered. You can use the [OnDrillDown Trigger](devenv-OnDrillDown-Trigger.md) instead.
