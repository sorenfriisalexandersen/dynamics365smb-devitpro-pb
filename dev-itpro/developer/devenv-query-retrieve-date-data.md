# Retrieving Date Data in Queries

When you have fields in a table that contain dates, you can use a date method to retrieve only the year, month, or day instead of including the date in the resulting dataset of a query.  
  
## Setting Up a Date Method on a Query Column  

To set up a date method on a query column, set the [Method Property](properties/devenv-method-property.md) to `Day`, `Month`, and `Year`.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You can only use a date method on fields that have a Date or DateTime data type. For additional information about how to use a date method on a field that has the DateTime data type, see [Working with DateTime Data Types](devenv-query-retrieve-date-data.md#DateTime).

 For more information about how to set up query columns and properties, see [Query Object](devenv-query-object.md).  
  
## Sample Table and Query

This article uses the following sample table and query to demonstrate the different date methods.  
  
### Sample Sales Header Table

The following table contains data about sales orders for customers. The **Order Date** field has the data type of Date and the format DD-MM-YYYY, where DD is the day, MM is the month, and YYYY is the year.  
  
|No.|Bill-to Name|Order Date|  
|---------|-------------------|----------------|  
|1000|Autohaus Meilberg KG|18-01-2019|  
|5000|Autohaus Meilberg KG|21-05-2019|  
|4000|Beef House|30-09-2017|  
|3000|Deerfield Graphics Company|05-04-2018|  
|3000|Deerfield Graphics Company|29-04-2018|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  This is a simplified subset of the data that is found in table 36 Sales Header of the [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)].
  
### Sample Query

The following query object retrieves data from the sample Sales Header table. The query includes a totals method that counts the total the number of records from the table included in the dataset.
  
```
query 50100 "Sample Data Query"
{
    QueryType = Normal;

    elements
    {
        dataitem(Sales_Header; "Sales Header")
        {
            column(Bill_to_Name; "Bill-to Name")
            {
            }

            column(Order_Date; "Order Date")
            {
                // Change the value of the property to Day, Month, or Year
                Method = Day;
            }

            column(Count_)
            {
                Method = Count;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  A column that applies a date method is still part of the group unlike columns that apply an aggregate method. 
  
## Day Method

 The `Day` method retrieves the day from the date expression of a field value in the query column. The day is returned as an integer, in the range of 1 to 31, which represents the day of the month. If the day in the date expression is 0, then 1 is returned.  
  
### Example

The following table displays the resulting dataset for the sample query with the `Method` property of the `Order Date` column set to `Day`.  
  
|Bill\_to\_Name|Day\_Order\_Date|Count\_|  
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------|  
|Autohaus Meilberg KG|18|1|  
|Autohaus Meilberg KG|21|1|  
|Beef House|30|1|  
|Deerfield Graphics Company|5|1|  
|Deerfield Graphics Company|29|1|  
  
## Month Method

 The `Month` method retrieves the month from the date expression of a field value in the query column. The month is returned as an integer, in the range of 1 to 12, where 1 represents January and 12 represents December. If the month in the date expression is 0, then 1 is returned.  
  
### Example  
 The following table displays the resulting dataset for the sample query with the `Method` property of the `Order Date` column set to `Month`.  
  
|Bill\_to\_Name|Month\_Order\_Date|Count\_|  
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------|  
|Autohaus Meilberg KG|1|1|  
|Autohaus Meilberg KG|5|1|  
|Beef House|9|1|  
|Deerfield Graphics Company|4|2|  
  
## Year Method

 The `Year` method gets the year from the date expression of a field value in the query column. The year is returned as an integer. If the year in the date expression is 0, then 1900 is returned.  
  
### Example

 The following table displays the resulting dataset for the sample query with the `Method` property of the `Order Date` column set to `Year`  
  
|Customer Name|Year\_Order\_Date|Count\_|  
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
|Autohaus Meilberg KG|2019|2|  
|Beef House|2017|1|  
|Deerfield Graphics Company|2018|2|  
  
##  <a name="DateTime"></a> Working with DateTime Data Types

 On the SQL server, date and time values are processed using Coordinated Universal Time \(UTC\). If your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] solution uses a time zone other than UTC and the field on which you apply the date method has a data type of DateTime, then there might be a difference between the date value that is returned in the dataset for the field and the actual day, month, or year for the field in the table. This occurs when the corresponding UTC date for a field falls on the next day or previous day because of the time of day and the time zone of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] solution. The following table includes examples of DateTime values for two time zones that will return days, months, and years in a dataset that differ from the values in the table.  
  
|Time Zone|Date and Time in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]|Day returned by Day method|Month returned by Month method|Year returned by Year method|  
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|Pacific Time \(UTC â€“8:00:00\)|12-31-2011 17:00:00|31|12|2018|  
|Middle European Time \(UTC +1:00:00\)|01-01-2012 00:59:00|1|1|2019|  
  
 The differences in day, month, or year occur because when a date and time value is retrieved from the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] database table, it is converted from the regional settings of the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] solution to the UTC date and time. The day, month, or year is calculated on the SQL server, and then returned to the query dataset as an integer, which does not consider the regional settings of the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] solution.  
  
 To avoid this condition, you should use the date method on fields that have a Date data type instead of a DateTime data type whenever possible. You can also return the DateTime value and implement post processing for the day, month, and year as needed.
