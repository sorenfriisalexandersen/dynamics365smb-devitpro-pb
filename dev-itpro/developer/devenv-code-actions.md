# AL Code Actions
The [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] offers users the option to help fix issues in code. Code Actions is a Visual Studio Code feature providing the user with possible corrective actions right next to an error or warning. If actions are available, a light bulb appears next to the error or warning. When the user clicks the light bulb (or presses Ctrl+.), a list of available Code Actions is presented. 

In [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] two code actions are available in the current version:

- Multiple IF to CASE converting code action.
- Spell check code action.

## To enable AL Code Actions
1. Open the Command Palette **Ctrl+P** and open the `settings.json` file.
2. Enter the setting `al.enableCodeActions` and set it to `true`: `"al.enableCodeActions": true`
3. Save the settings file. You have now enabled code actions on your project.

Alternatively:

1. Open the Settings Page, **Ctrl+,** and choose either **User Settings** or **Workspace Settings** depending on which scope you want the code actions to apply to.
2. Navigate to **Extensions > AL Language extension configuration**.
3. Click on the **Enable Code Actions** checkbox. You have now enabled code actions on your project.
