# SetFilter Method
Sets a filter on a column of a query to limit the records in the resulting data set of a query.


## Syntax
```
 Query.SetFilter(Column: Any, String: String [, Value: Any,...])
```
## Parameters
*Query*  
&emsp;Type: [Query](query-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [Query](query-data-type.md) data type.  

*Column*  
&emsp;Type: [Any](../any/any-data-type.md)  
The name of the column in the query that you want to filter. The name is defined by the column's Name Property.
        
*String*  
&emsp;Type: [String](../string/string-data-type.md)  
The filter expression. A valid expression consists of alphanumeric characters and one or more of the following operators: \<, >, \, &, &#124;, and =. You can use replacement fields (%1, %2, and so on) to insert values at run-time.
        
*Value*  
&emsp;Type: [Any](../any/any-data-type.md)  
Replacement values to insert in replacement fields in the filter expression. The data type of Value must match the data type of field that is referred to by the ColumnName.

## Remarks  
 To apply filters to a dataset, the **SETFILTER** method must be called before the **OPEN**, **SAVEASXML**, and **SAVEASCSV** methods, as shown in the following example. To remove filters from query, you call the [CLEAR Method](../../methods/devenv-clear-method.md).  
  
```  
Query.SETFILTER(Column1, String);  
Query.OPEN;  
Query.READ;  
CLEAR(Query);  
```  
  
 A call to the **SETFILTER** method automatically closes a query dataset that is currently open. Therefore, the following code is unauthorized and will fail because there is no open dataset for the **READ** method to read.  
  
```  
Query.OPEN;  
Query.READ;  
Query.SETFILTER(Column2, String);  
Query.READ;  
```  
  
 You can have multiple calls to the **SETFILTER** method. If **SETFILTER** method calls set filters on different columns, then the filters are combined and applied to the dataset. If consecutive **SETFILTER** method calls set filters on the same column, then the last **SETFILTER** method call is applied to the column.  
  
 In addition to the **SETFILTER** method, you can apply filters to a query using the [SETRANGE Method \(Query\)](../../methods/devenv-setrange-method-query.md) method, the **FILTERGROUP** method, and the [DataItemTableFilter Property](../../properties/devenv-dataitemtable-filter-property.md) and [ColumnFilter Property](../../properties/devenv-columnfilter-property.md) in Query Designer.  
  
|If the **SETFILTER** method...|then...|  
|--------------------------------------|-------------|  
|Sets a filter on the same field as the **DataItemTableFilter** property|The two filters are joined into a resulting filter.|  
|Sets a filter on the same field as the **ColumnFilter** property|The **SETFILTER** method overwrites the **ColumnFilter** property, so the filter that is set by the **SETFILTER** method that is applied to the dataset.|  
|Sets a filter on the same field as the **SETRANGE** method|The method that is called last is applied to the dataset.|  
|Sets a filter on a field that has global filters that are applied by the **FILTERGROUP\(1\)** method|The filters of the **SETFILTER** method are added to the global filters.|  
  
 For example, a query has the following filters set on the **Quantity** column in Query Designer:  
  
-   **DataItemTableFilter** property: Quantity=FILTER\(\<100\)  
  
-   **ColumnFilter** property: Quantity=FILTER\(\<>50\)  
  
 `Query.SETFILTER ("Quantity", '>1â€™)` will result in a filter that is equivalent to: 1\<Quantity \<100.  
  
 <!--Links For more information about how to set filters in Query Designer, see [Understanding Query Filters](Understanding-Query-Filters.md).-->  
  
## Example  
 The following AL code example demonstrates how to use the **SETFILTER** method on a query. The example code sets a filter on a query column, and then displays a message when the query is run that indicates the filter on the column.  
  
 This example requires that you create a query called **Customer\_SalesQuantity** that has the following characteristics:  
  
  -   Links table 18, Customer with table 37, Sales Lines from the [!INCLUDE[demolong](../../includes/demolong_md.md)].  

  -   Includes columns for the **Name** and **No.** fields from the **Customer** table and the **Quantity** field from **Sales Lines** table.  

        <!--NAV For step-by-step instructions for creating this query, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Query to Link Two Tables](Walkthrough--Creating-a-Query-to-Link-Two-Tables.md).-->  
  
```  
var
  MyQuery: Query "Customer SalesQuantity";
  Text000: Label 'Customer name = %1, Quantity = %2';
begin
    // Sets a filter to display only sales quantities greater than 10.  
    MyQuery.SETFILTER(Quantity, '>10');  
    // Sets a filter to display the columns with the value Selangorian Ltd. only.  
    MyQuery.SETFILTER(NAME, 'Selangorian Ltd.');  
    // Runs the query.  
    MyQuery.OPEN;  
    // Reads each row in the dataset and displays message with column values.  
    // Stops reading when there are no more rows remaining in the dataset (READ is FALSE).  
    while MyQuery.READ do  
    begin  
      MESSAGE(Text000, MyQuery.Name, MyQuery.Quantity);  
    end;   
    // Saves the resulting dataset as a CSV file.  
    MyQuery.SAVEASCSV('c:\temp\CustomerSales.csv');  
    // Closes the query.  
    Myquery.CLOSE; 
end;
```  
  
 When the code is run, a message that resembles the following appears for each row in the dataset:  
  
 **Customer name = Selangorian Ltd., Quantity = 30**
