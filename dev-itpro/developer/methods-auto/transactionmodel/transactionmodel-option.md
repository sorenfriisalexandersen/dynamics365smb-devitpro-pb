# TransactionModel Option Type
Represents a test transaction model.

## Members
|  Member  |  Description  |
|----------------|---------------|
|AutoCommit|The transaction automatically commits after the Test method has run.|
|AutoRollback|The transaction is automatically rolled back after the Test method has run.|
|None|No write-transaction is open in the test-method code, and writes will fail. The transaction model mirrors the model used by the "real" client. Every call from the TestPage to the "server" has its own transaction.|
