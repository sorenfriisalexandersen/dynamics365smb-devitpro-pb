# FilterPageBuilder Data Type
Stores filter configurations for a filter page. A filter page is a dynamic page type that contains one or more filter controls that enables users to set filters on fields of the underlying tables.



The following methods are available on instances of the FilterPageBuilder data type.

|Method name|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|[AddTable(String, Integer)](filterpagebuilder-addtable-method.md)|Adds filter control for a table to a filter page.|
|[AddRecord(String, Record)](filterpagebuilder-addrecord-method.md)|Adds a filter control for a table to a filter page. The table is specified by a record data type variable that is passed to the method.|
|[AddRecordRef(String, RecordRef)](filterpagebuilder-addrecordref-method.md)|Adds a filter control for a table to a filter page. The table is specified by a RecordRef variable that is passed to the method. This creates a filter control on the filter page, where users can set filter table data.|
|[AddField(String, Any [, String])](filterpagebuilder-addfield-string-joker-string-method.md)|Adds a table field to the filter control for a table on filter page.|
