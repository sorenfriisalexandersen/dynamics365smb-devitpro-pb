# Relation Method
Finds the table relationship of a given field.


## Syntax
```
TableNumber :=   FieldRef.Relation()
```
> [!NOTE]  
> This method can be invoked using property access syntax.  

## Parameters
*FieldRef*  
&emsp;Type: [FieldRef](fieldref-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [FieldRef](fieldref-data-type.md) data type.  

## Return Value
*TableNumber*  
&emsp;Type: [Integer](../integer/integer-data-type.md)  
  


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


## Remarks  
 You can use this method for several purposes such as to determine lookups or to check to see if you have permission to read from a table.  
  
 This method is similar to the [RELATION Method \(Record\)](../../methods-auto/record/record-relation-method.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example opens table 37, the Sales Line table, as a RecordRef variable and creates a reference to field 2 \(Sell-to Customer No.\). The [FieldRef Data Type](../../datatypes/devenv-fieldref-data-type.md) of field 2 is stored in the MyFieldRef variable. The RELATION method retrieves the number of the table that has a relation with the Sell-To-Customer field \(field 2\). The table number is stored the varRelation variable and displayed in the message box. 

```
var
    MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
    SaleRecref: RecordRef;
    varRelation: Integer;
    Text000: Label 'Field 2 in the Sales Line (37) table has a relation with table %1.';
begin
    SaleRecref.OPEN(37);  
    MyFieldRef := SaleRecref.FIELD(2);  
    varRelation := MyFieldRef.RELATION;  
    MESSAGE(Text000, varRelation);  
end;
```
