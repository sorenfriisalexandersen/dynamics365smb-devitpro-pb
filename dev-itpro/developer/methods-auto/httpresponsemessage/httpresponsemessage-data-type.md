## Remarks
The size of the `HttpResponseMessage` is determined by the `HttpClient AL Function Response Size` setting on the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] server. The default value is `150`. For more information, see [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Server Configuration](../../../administration/configure-server-instance.md).

> [!NOTE]   
> For performance reasons all HTTP, JSON, TextBuilder, and XML types are reference types, not value types. Reference types holds a pointer to the data elsewhere in memory, whereas value types store its own data.
