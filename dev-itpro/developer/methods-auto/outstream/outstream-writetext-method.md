## Remarks

For more information about how zero bytes and line endings are written and read, see [WRITE, WRITETEXT, READ, and READTEXT Method Behavior Regarding Line Endings and Zero Terminators](../../devenv-write-read-methods-line-break-behavior.md).
## Example  

 This example also requires that the c:\\TestFiles folder exists.  
  
```  
 var
    MyHTMLFile: File;
    TestOutStream: OutStream;
begin
    MyHTMLFile.CREATE('c:\TestFiles\main.html');  
    MyHTMLFile.CREATEOUTSTREAM(TestOutStream);  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT('<html>');  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT;  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT('<head>');  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT('<title>My Page</title>');  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT('</head>');  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT;  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT('<P>Hello world!</p>');  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT;  
    TestOutStream.WRITETEXT('</html>');  
    FileMyHTML.CLOSE;  
end;
```
