The displayed text format of the date is determined by your Region and Language Format setting in Windows.  
  
## Undefined dates  
 An undefined or blank date is specified by 0D. The undefined date is considered to be before all other dates.  
  
## Normal dates and closing dates  
 All normal dates have a corresponding closing date. The closing date for a given date is defined as a period of time that follows a given normal date and precedes the next normal date.  
  
## Syntax
The syntax for defining DateTime format follows the [ISO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). 
- The syntax for defining Date format is `yyyymmddD`, where `D` is a mandatory letter. For example, `20180325D`, read as the 25th of March, 2018.

 To assign a normal date to a variable, use the following format: `yyyymmddD`. 
  
## Storing dates in the SQL server database  
 SQL Server stores information about both date and time in columns of the DATETIME types. For date fields, [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] uses only the date and uses a constant value for the time. For a normal date, this constant value contains 00:00:00:000. For a closing date, it contains 23:59:59:000.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] undefined date is represented by the earliest valid date in SQL Server. The earliest valid date in SQL Server for a DATETIME is 01-01-1753 00:00:00:000.  
  
 If you store a date in the database that is outside the valid range for a SQL DATETIME, a run-time error occurs.  


## Example  
This example shows a valid assignment of date. This example is compiled and run on a computer with the regional format set to English (United States).

```  
var
    Date1: Date;
begin
    Date1 := 20180612D;  
    MESSAGE(FORMAT(Date1));  
end;
```  
  
The message window displays the following:  
  
 **06/12/2018**
