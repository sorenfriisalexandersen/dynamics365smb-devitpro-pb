# Erase Method
Deletes a file.

> [!NOTE]
> This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.

## Syntax
```
[Ok := ]  File.Erase(Name: String)
```
> [!NOTE]  
> This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.  
## Parameters
*Name*  
&emsp;Type: [String](../string/string-data-type.md)  
The name of the file that you want to delete, including the path. When you enter the path, consider these shortcuts:
-   You can omit the drive designation if the file is located on the current drive.
-   You can omit the full path if the file is located in the current directory.
-   You can enter only the subdirectory name if the file is located in a subdirectory of the current directory.
          


## Return Value
*Ok*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**.  If you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.    


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

If the user who runs this method does not have the required permission to delete the file or if the file is read-only, then the file is not deleted.  
  
## Example  
 The following example deletes the file that is named C:\\TestFolder\\NewTestFile.txt.This example assumes that you have created the file on your computer.  
  
```  
ERASE('C:\TestFolder\NewTestFile.txt');  
```
