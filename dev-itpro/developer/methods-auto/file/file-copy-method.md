# Copy Method
Copies a file.

> [!NOTE]
> This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.

## Syntax
```
[Ok := ]  File.Copy(FromName: String, ToName: String)
```
> [!NOTE]  
> This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.  
## Parameters
*FromName*  
&emsp;Type: [String](../string/string-data-type.md)  
The name of the file that you want to make a copy of, including its path. When you enter the path, consider these shortcuts:
-   You can omit the drive designation if the file is located on the current drive.
-   You can omit the full path if the file is located in the current directory.
-   You can enter only the subdirectory name if the file is located in a subdirectory of the current directory.
          
*ToName*  
&emsp;Type: [String](../string/string-data-type.md)  
The name that you want to assign to the copy that includes its path. When you enter the path, consider these shortcuts:
-   You can omit the drive designation if the file is located on the current drive.
-   You can omit the full path if the file is located in the current directory.
-   You can enter only the subdirectory name if the file is located in a subdirectory of the current directory.
          


## Return Value
*Ok*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**.  If you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.    


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 If you do not use the return value and the file cannot be copied, a run-time error will occur. If you do include the return value in your code, you must handle any errors yourself.  
  
## Example  
 The following example copies a file that is named OldFile from a folder that is named Old on drive C to a folder that is named New. If the file is copied, a message is displayed and the program continues. Otherwise, an error occurs. This example assumes that you have created the following file 'c:\\Old\\' OldFile.  

```
 var
    OldFile: Text;
    NewFile: Text;
begin
    OldFile := 'old.txt';  
    NewFile := 'new.txt';  
    if FILE.COPY('c:\Old\' + OldFile, 'c:\New\' + NewFile) then  
      // Continue your program.  
      MESSAGE('The file was copied.');  
    else  
      // Handle the error.  
      MESSAGE('The file was not copied.');  
end;
```
