# SessionSettings Data Type
Is a complex data type for passing user personalization settings for a client session as an object. The object contains properties that correspond to the fields in the system table **2000000073 User Personalization**, including: App ID, Company, Language ID, Locale ID, Profile ID, Scope, and Time Zone. You can use the AL methods of the SessionSettings data type to get, set, and send the user personalization settings for the current client session.



The following methods are available on instances of the SessionSettings data type.

|Method name|Description|

|[Company([String])](sessionsettings-company-method.md)|Gets or sets the company property in a SessionSettings object.|
|[ProfileId([String])](sessionsettings-profileid-method.md)|Gets or sets the profile ID property in a SessionSettings object.|
