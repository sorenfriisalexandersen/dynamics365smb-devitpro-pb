The following are examples of durations:  
  
 DATETIME-DATETIME=DURATION  
  
 DATETIME-DURATION=DATETIME  
  
 DATETIME+DURATION=DATETIME  
  
## Example  
 This example shows how to calculate the difference between two DateTimes. This example is run on a computer with the Current Format in the Regional and Language Options set to English (United States).  
  
```  
var
    DateTime1: DateTime;
    DateTime2: DateTime1;
    Duration: Duration;
begin
    DateTime1 := CREATEDATETIME(20090101D, 080000T); // January 1, 2009 at 08:00:00 AM  
    DateTime2 := CREATEDATETIME(20090505D, 133001T); // May 5, 2009 at 1:30:01 PM  
    Duration := DateTime2 - DateTime1;  
    MESSAGE(FORMAT(Duration));  
end;
```  
  
 The message window displays the following:  
  
 **124 days 4 hours 30 minutes 1 second**
