# CheckLicenseFile Method

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 The license file turns on or off different system capabilities. Use this method to check a key in the file for the current user. If the user has no access rights to the object, a message is displayed and the process is terminated.  
  
 If you omit this method, the user will have the ability to continue regardless of whether the appropriate license file is open.
