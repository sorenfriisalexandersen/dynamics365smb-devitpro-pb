# CopyCompany Method
Creates a new company and copies all data from an existing company in the same database.


## Syntax
```
[Ok := ]  Database.CopyCompany(SourceName: String, DestinationName: String)
```
> [!NOTE]  
> This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.  
## Parameters
*SourceName*  
&emsp;Type: [String](../string/string-data-type.md)  
The name of the company that you want to copy data from.
        
*DestinationName*  
&emsp;Type: [String](../string/string-data-type.md)  
The name of the company that you want to create and copy data to. The company name can have a maximum of 30 characters. If the database collation is case-sensitive, you can have one company called COMPANY and another called Company. However, if the database is case-insensitive, you cannot create companies with names that differ only by case.  


## Return Value
*Ok*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**.  If you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.    


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

Links and notes on records are not copied to the new company.

## Example  
 The following example is based on the **Copy Company** batch job, which is part of the [!INCLUDE[demo](../../includes/demo_md.md)]. The batch job takes the Company system table as a data item and uses the **Name** field as the value of the *SourceName* parameter. The value of the *DestinationName* parameter is specified in the **New Company Name** field in the request page, which is represented by the `NewCompanyName` variable.  

```  
COPYCOMPANY(Name, NewCompanyName);  
```
