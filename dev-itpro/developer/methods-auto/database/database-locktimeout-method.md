# LockTimeout Method
Determines whether the lock time-out setting is set to On. You can also use this method to override the default setting.


## Syntax
```
[LockTimeout := ]  Database.LockTimeout([LockTimeout: Boolean])
```
> [!NOTE]  
> This method can be invoked using property access syntax.  
> [!NOTE]  
> This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.  
## Parameters
*LockTimeout*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
The new setting for whether the lock time-out is on.  


## Return Value
*LockTimeout*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
This value shows whether to use a lock time-out.  


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 This method has been designed specifically for use in long-running processes that should not be terminated because of a lock time-out, for example batch jobs that run overnight.  

When the AL code has finished running, the default setting is used again. This method does not change the duration of a lock time-out.
