# SelectLatestVersion Method
Forces the latest version of the database to be used.


## Syntax
```
 Database.SelectLatestVersion()
```
> [!NOTE]  
> This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.  



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 This method makes sure that the data displayed is the most current data in the database. The method clears all non-locked records from the client cache, thereby ensuring that you read the most recent data. The method also clears the current client session's cache for the CaptionClassTranslate strings. The strings will then be reevaluated by the **CaptionClassTranslate** method trigger \(ID 15\) in codeunit 1.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
> Clearing the cache and reading data directly from the database adversely affects performance.
