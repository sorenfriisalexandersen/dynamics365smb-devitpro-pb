# Code Data Type
Denotes a special type of string that is converted to uppercase and removes any trailing or leading spaces.




[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 The length of a Code variable equals the number of characters in the text without leading or trailing spaces.  
  
 You must specify the length of a Code variable or field. The maximum length of a Code variable is 1024 characters. The maximum length of a Code field in a table is 2048 characters. A Code variable cannot be null. The Code data type supports Unicode.  
  
 You can index any character position in a string, such as A[65]. The resulting value will be a [Char Data Type](../char/char-data-type.md). You cannot assign a char to a position in the code variable greater than the current length of the variable +1. 
  
 Fields that contain a date formula must not have data type Code. Instead, use the [DateFormula Data Type](../dateformula/dateformula-data-type.md). All fields that contain a date formula with data type Code must be converted into data type DateFormula.  
    
  

## Example  
 This example shows some typical examples of code string assignments. In these examples, assume that the variable c is a code variable with a maximum length of 4.  
  
```  
c := 'ABC';   
// Results in variable c, which contains 'ABC'   
// and is 3 characters in length.  
c := '1';  
// Results in variable c, which contains '1'   
// and is 1 character in length.  
c := '';  
// Results in variable c, which contains '' (empty string)  
// and is zero (0) characters in length.  
c := ' 2 ';  
// Results in variable c, which contains '2'  
// and is 1 character in length.  
```
