## Remarks
You use this method as part of the upgrade code for an extension, where it is called from the `OnNavAppUpgradePerDatabase()` or `OnNavAppUpgradePerCompany()` system methods. When an extension is uninstalled, the data in application tables of the extension is automatically stored into a set of special tables so that the data is still preserved. With the RESTOREARCHIVEDATA method, you can restore the archived data to the application table of the new version of an extension when it is installed.
