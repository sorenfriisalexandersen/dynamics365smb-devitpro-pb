Selects a key for a table.


## Syntax
```
[Ok := ]  Record.SetCurrentKey(Field1: Any [, Field2: Any,...])
```
## Parameters
*Record*  
&emsp;Type: [Record](record-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [Record](record-data-type.md) data type.  

*Field1*  
&emsp;Type: [Any](../any/any-data-type.md)  
  
*Field2*  
&emsp;Type: [Any](../any/any-data-type.md)  
  


## Return Value
*Ok*

## Remarks 

You can use SetCurrentKey for selecting a key and sorting When you use SetCurrentKey the following rules apply:  

- Inactive fields are ignored. Only active keys are scanned.  

- When searching for a key, the first occurrence of the specified fields is selected. This means the following:  

  - If you specify only one field as a parameter when you call SetCurrentKey, the key that is actually selected may consist of more than one field.  

  - If the field that you specify is the first component of several keys, the key that is selected may not be the key that you expect.  

  - If no keys can be found that include the fields that you specify, the return value is **false**. If you do not test the return value, a run-time error occurs. If you do test the return value, the program will continue to run even though no key was found.
