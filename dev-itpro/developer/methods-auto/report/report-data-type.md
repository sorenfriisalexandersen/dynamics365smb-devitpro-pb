|[RunModal(Integer [, Boolean] [, Boolean] [, var Record])](report-runmodal-method.md)|Loads and executes the report that you specify.|
|[SaveAsHtml(Integer, String [, var Record])](report-saveashtml-method.md)|Saves a report as an HTML file. The file is saved on the computer where the server instance is running, and then downloaded to the client when ready. > This method is only supported when a report uses a Word report layout when it is run.|
|[SaveAsXml(Integer, String [, var Record])](report-saveasxml-method.md)|Saves the resulting data set of a query as an .xml file. The following code shows the syntax of the SAVEASXML function. The first line of code is the syntax for an instance method call. The second line of code is the syntax for a static method call.|

The second line of code is the syntax for a static method call.|
|[WordLayout(Integer, InStream)](report-wordlayout-method.md)|Gets the Word report layout that is used on a report and returns it as a data stream. The method has an instance call and a static call. The following code shows the syntax of the WORDLAYOUT function. The first line of code is the syntax for an instance method call. The second line of code is the syntax for a static method call.|
|[RdlcLayout(Integer, InStream)](report-rdlclayout-method.md)|Gets the RDLC layout that is used on a report and returns it as a data stream. The method has an instance call and a static call. The following code shows the syntax of the RDLC function. The first line of code is the syntax for an instance method call. The second line of code is the syntax for a static method call.|

|[Execute(Integer, String [, RecordRef])](report-execute-method.md)|Runs a report in preview or processing-only mode without showing the request page in the client. The method gets the request page parameter values as an input parameter string from a RUNREQUESTPAGE method call. The OnOpen and OnClose triggers on the request page will run even though the request page is not shown.|
|[Print(Integer, String [, String] [, RecordRef])](report-print-method.md)|Prints a specified report without running the request page. Instead of using the request page to obtain parameters at runtime, the method gets the parameter values as an input parameter string, typically from a RUNREQUESTPAGE method call.|
|[SaveAs(Integer, String, ReportFormat, var OutStream [, RecordRef])](report-saveas-method.md)|Runs a specific report without a request page and saves the report as a PDF, Excel, Word, HTML, or XML file. Instead of using the request page to obtain parameters at runtime, the method gets the parameter values as an input parameter string, typically from the return value of a RUNREQUESTPAGE method call.|
|[GetSubstituteReportId(Integer)](report-getsubstitutereportid-method.md)|Gets the ID of the report that will be run by the platform after considering any substitutions made by extensions.|
