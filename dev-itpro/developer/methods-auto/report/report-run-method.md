```
 Report.Run(Number: Integer [, RequestWindow: Boolean] [, SystemPrinter: Boolean] [, var Record: Record])
```
## Parameters
*Number*  
&emsp;Type: [Integer](../integer/integer-data-type.md)

*RequestWindow*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
Specifies whether the request window for the report will be displayed. The request window is part of the report object.
        
*SystemPrinter*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
Specifies whether to use the default Windows printer or use table 78, Printer Selection, to find the correct printer for this report.

## Remarks  

Use this method, or the [REPORT.RUNMODAL Method](report-runmodal-method.md), if you do not know the specific report that you want to run when you are designing your application. If you do know the specific report that you want to run, then you can use the [RUN Method](reportinstance-run-method.md) or the [RUNMODAL Method](reportinstance-runmodal-method.md). 
  
If the report you specify does not exist, then a compile error occurs.
