# RDLCLayout Method
Gets the RDLC layout that is used on a report and returns it as a data stream.The method has an instance call and a static call. The following code shows the syntax of the RDLC method. The first line of code is the syntax for an instance method call. The second line of code is the syntax for a static method call.


## Syntax
```
[Ok := ]  Report.RDLCLayout(var InStream: InStream)
```
## Parameters
*Report*  
&emsp;Type: [Report](report-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [Report](report-data-type.md) data type.  

*InStream*  
&emsp;Type: [InStream](../instream/instream-data-type.md)  
The variable in which to return the RDLC layout.
          


## Return Value
*Ok*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**.  If you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.    


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

  
## Remarks  
 Using the return value is optional. When you use the return value, if the RDLC layout cannot be retrieved at run-time, then the system returns **false** and no error recorded. When you omit the return value, if the RDLC layout cannot be retrieved at run-time, then an error occurs, which states that the layout could not be retrieved.
