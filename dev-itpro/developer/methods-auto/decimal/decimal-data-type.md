# Decimal Data Type
Denotes decimal numbers ranging from -999,999,999,999,999.99 to +999,999,999,999,999.99.

## Example  
 The following are examples of decimal values.  

```  
546.88  
3425.57  
```  

## Example  
 The following is not a decimal, but rather an [Integer Data Type](../../datatypes/devenv-integer-data-type.md).  

```  
342  
```  

## Limits on Decimal Data Type Variables  

The Decimal data type is mapped to the Microsoft .NET Framework common language runtime \(CLR\) Decimal data type, which controls and the precision and limits for variables.  

The following table shows the limits for variables of type `Decimal`.  

|Limit|Value|
|-----------|------------------------------|  
|Maximum format value.<br /><br /> This is the maximum value that can be:<br /><br /> -   Formatted into a TEXT variable by the FORMAT function.<br />-   Input from the UI or XMLPorts.<br />-   Assigned directly in source code.|+/- 999,999,999,999,999.99|
|Maximum field data type value.<br /><br /> This is the maximum value that a field variable in a record can hold while not being persisted.|+/- 999,999,999,999,999.99| 
|Maximum persisted value.<br /><br /> This is the maximum value that can be stored in the database.|Can read previous stored values but cannot store values outside the formatting range since field variables cannot be assigned values outside the formatting range.|
|Maximum calculating value.<br /><br /> This is the maximum value that can be calculated by code statements while not assigning to a field variable, storing to the database, or formatting to a text variable.|+/- 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335|
|Scaling factor (digits after decimal point) for calculating values|28<br /><br />For example, 7.9228162514264337593543950335|  

It is possible to assign to a variable the maximum value that can be formatted and then multiply that variable by a large positive number, thereby generating a greater value. However, we do not recommend doing this. If you do, you will get errors if you attempt to format this variable to a text variable or assign the variable to a field variable in a record.
