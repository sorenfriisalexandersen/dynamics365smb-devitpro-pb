# Country/regional availability and supported languages

This page lists the countries/regions where [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] is available and which languages are supported.

> [!NOTE]
> In countries where Microsoft has not delivered a localization, partners can build [localizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/readiness/readiness-develop-localization) using translation and localization apps that are published on AppSource. These apps are built on top of the international (W1) version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. 

The following table provides the list of all countries/regions where [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] is available or in planning for future availability, and states whether the localization is provided by Microsoft or partner(s).

## Important information regarding planned availability
Due to the nature of the joint effort where Microsoft is providing the international (W1) cloud service and partners are providing localization app(s), the above planned availability estimates represent the earliest possible availability and can be exceeded if localization partners have not successfully published their app(s) to AppSource by this time.

## Supported languages
To maximize productivity [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] supports many languages.
It is important to know that language support requires translation of *platform* captions and *application* captions (UI). 
Translated platform captions are provided by Microsoft for all supported languages. Application languages are provided by both Microsoft and partners, depending on the language.

Application languages delivered by Microsoft are provided as language apps, available on AppSource, that can be installed if needed. Partners can also provide application translation for any platform supported language. To use one of these languages the app publisher must be contacted through AppSource.

This table gives an overview of supported languages and how  application languages are provided.

> [!NOTE]
> Application translations provided by Microsoft cover features in the international version (W1). Local functionality is not translated to all languages and will be provided in English and native language, as has been done historically. As a result, you may experience a mix of translations if using [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] in a foreign language.
