## Partner Supported Countries/Regions and Translations

In countries where Microsoft has not delivered a localization, partners can build [localizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/readiness/readiness-develop-localization) using translation and localization apps that are published on AppSource. These apps are built on top of the international (W1) version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. The following table provides the list of countries/regions and translations supported through partners.

|Country/Region|Language Code|
|-------|-------------|
|Estonia|et-EE|
|Hong Kong SAR|zh-HK|
|Indonesia|en-US|
|Japan|ja-JP|
|Malaysia|en-US|
|Philippines|en-US|
|Poland|pl-PL|
|Portugal|pt-PT|
|Serbia|sr-latn-RS|
|Singapore|en-US|
|South Africa|en-ZA|
|South Korea|ko-KR|
|Taiwan|zh-TW|
|Thailand|en-US|
|United Arab Emirates|en-US|
|Vietnam|en-US|

## Planned Future Availability

[!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] is planned for future availability in the following countries/regions.

Due to the nature of the joint effort where Microsoft is providing the international (W1) cloud service and partners are providing localization app(s), the below dates represent the earliest possible availability and can be exceeded if localization partners have not successfully published their app(s) to AppSource by this time. 

|Country/Region|Language Code|Planned Availability|
|-------|-------------|-------------|
|Colombia|es-ES|2020 Wave 1|
|Croatia|hr-HR|2020 Wave 1|
|Czechia|cz-CZ|February 2020|
|Hungary|hu-HU|2020 Wave 1|
|Latvia|lv-LV|2020 Wave 1|
