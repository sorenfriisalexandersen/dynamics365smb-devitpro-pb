# Walkthrough: Creating and Interacting With an OData V4 Bound Action
This walkthrough illustrates how you can publish a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] function as an OData V4 web service action. 

## About This Walkthrough  
This walkthrough provides an overview of how to expose a function as a web service action and how to verify that the service is working as expected. The walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:

-   Publishing a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] function as a web service.    
-   Verifying web service availability from a browser.
  
### Prerequisites  
To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](../developer/includes/navnowlong_md.md)] CTP 10 with a developer license.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[demolong](../developer/includes/demolong_md.md)].  
  
-   The **Postman** app for testing the web service URI.
  
## Publishing a Function as a Web Service   
You publish a function as a Web service action by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] to create the function and the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Windows client or the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Web client for publishing the objects the function is for. The tutorial provides an example that will return a location header. A location header would be used to later issue a get request for the resulting object. Refer to the **Return a Value** section for an example that will return a value specified in your function.
  
### To create the function

#### Create a Copy action on the Sales Invoice page.

1.  Open the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] and then connect to the [!INCLUDE[demoname](../developer/includes/demoname_md.md)] company.  
  
     Object Designer opens automatically in the development environment.  

2.	Open page 43, **Sales Invoice**.
3.	Create a new function on the page named `Copy`.
4.	Open the properties for the function and set the properties to the following values.
  
    |Property|Value|
    |--------|-----|
    |Local   |No   |
    |FunctionVisibility|External|
    |ServiceEnabled|Yes|

5.	Open **Locals** for the function and set the parameters to the following values.
  
    |Parameter|Value|
    |---------|-----|
    |VAR|Yes|
    |Name|ActionContext|
    |DataType|DotNet|
    |SubType|Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Runtime.WebServiceActionContext.'Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Ncl, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'|

6.	Select the **Variables** tab and add the following variables.  

    |Name|DataType|SubType|
    |----|--------|-------|
    |ToSalesHeader|Record|36|
    |FromSalesHeader|Record|36|
    |SalesSetup|Record|311|
    |ODataActionManagement|Codeunit|6711|
    |CopyDocMgt|Codeunit|6620|
    |DocType|Option|OptionString = Quote,Blanket Order,Order,Invoice,Return Order,Credit Memo,Posted Shipment,Posted Invoice,Posted Return Receipt,Posted Credit Memo|

 7.	Add the code that copies the sales document, for example.
    
    ```
    SalesSetup.GET;
    CopyDocMgt.SetProperties(
    TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,SalesSetup."Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory",FALSE);

    FromSalesHeader.GET(Rec."Document Type",Rec."No.");
    ToSalesHeader."Document Type" := FromSalesHeader."Document Type";
    ToSalesHeader.INSERT(TRUE);
    CopyDocMgt.CopySalesDoc(DocType::Invoice,FromSalesHeader."No.",ToSalesHeader);

    // Add the necessary keys of the newly created entity using that entity’s backing table to identify the field no. and it’s value.
    ODataActionManagement.AddKey(Rec.FIELDNO(Id),ToSalesHeader.Id);

    // Depending on what the result was of the action
    // - Created: SetCreatedPageResponse(ActionContext, PAGE::"Sales Invoice");
    // - Updated: SetUpdatedPageResponse(ActionContext,PAGE::"Sales Invoice");
    // - Deleted: SetDeleteResponse(ActionContext);
    ODataActionManagement.SetCreatedPageResponse(ActionContext,PAGE::"Sales Invoice");
    ```
8. Save and compile the **SalesInvoice** page.

### To register and publish a page as a Web service

1.	Open [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] and connect to the CRONUS International Ltd. company.
2.	In the **Search** box, enter **Web services**, and then choose the related link.
3.	In the **Web Services** page, on the **Home** tab, choose **New**.
4.	In the **Object Type** column, select **Page**. In the **Object ID** column, enter `43`, and in the **Service Name** column, enter `SalesInvoice`.
5.	Select the check box in the **Published** column.
6.	Choose the **OK** button.

## Verifying the Web Service Availability 
After publishing a web service, verify that the port that web service applications will use to connect to your web service is open. The default port for OData V4 web services is 7047. You can configure this value by using the [Server Administration Tool](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh165851(v=nav.90).aspx).

### To verify availability of a Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web service action

1.	Start **Postman** or another tool that can execute a POST command against the web service URI.
2.	In the **Address** field, enter a URI in this format: `https://<Server>:<WebServicePort>/<ServerInstance>/api/beta/companies(<companyid>)/salesInvoices(<invoiceid>)/Microsoft.NAV.Copy)`.  

    - `<Server>` is the name of the computer that is running Business Central Server.
    - `<WebServicePort>` is the port that OData V4 is running on. The default port is 7047.
    - `<ServiceInstance>` is the name of the Business Central Server instance for your solution. The default name is DynamicsNAV90.  

    Example if the default Business Central Server is running on your local computer.
    ```https://localhost:7047/BC130/api/beta/companies(b9248a6e-966d-478c-a25d-d91d28610397)/salesInvoices(8cc52602-3aa4-4256-b2c7-fdfef5248cbf)/Microsoft.NAV.Copy) ```
3. Postman should now show the web service function that you have published, and perform the action of copying an invoice. 

## Return a value

1.	Open the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] and connect to the application database.
2.	Open page 43, **Sales Invoice**.
3.	Create a new function called **Example**.
4.	Open **Properties** for the function and set the properties to the following values.
  
    |Property|Value|
    |--------|-----|
    |Local|No|
    |FunctionVisibility|External|
    |ServiceEnabled|Yes|

5. Open **Locals** for the function parameters to the following values.
1.   
    |Parameter|Value|test|
    |---------|-----|-----|
    |inParam  | Text| test|  
    <!-- check this table --> 
    
6. Select the **Return Value** tab and then add the following values.
1.    
    |Name|ReturnType|
    |----|----------|
    |outParam|Text|
    <!-- check this table -->
        
7.	Then add the following code for the **Example** function:  

    `outParam := inParam + ' Completed';`

8.	You can now issue a post request:  
    `https://localhost:7047/Navision_NAV/ODataV4/Company('CRONUS International Ltd.')/SalesInvoice('Invoice', '1004')/NAV.Example`  
    with a JSON body of:  
    `{
	    "inParam": "Hello World"
    }`
9.	The returned value will be returned in the body of the message.  
    ```
    {
        "@odata.context": "https://farpedro.northamerica.corp.microsoft.com:7047/Navision_NAV/ODataV4/$metadata#Edm.String",
        "value": "Hello World Completed"
    }
    ```

You have now published a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] function as an OData V4 web service action and verified that the service works as expected. To read more about web services, see the **See Also** section below.
