# SOAP Web Services
SOAP web services enable full flexibility for building operation-centric services. They provide industry-standard interoperability and channel and host pluggability.  
  
 You can use SOAP to interact with page or codeunit web services in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] .
